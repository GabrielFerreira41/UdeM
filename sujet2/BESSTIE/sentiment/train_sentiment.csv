"This was one of the best dishes I've EVER had! I have very high standards, and I also comparing to Melbourne cafes. There was a generous amount of mushrooms, perfectly cooked. There was an AMAZING onion jam thing, the truffle mayo was absolutely incredible! Very reasonably priced. I asked for sourdough instead of brioche which was happily done, but the bread was very soggy when I got the plate. I could move to Mackay just for this And as vegetarians, I REALLY appreciate you for not charging us the extra 4 for replacing the bacon with avo in your ' bacon and eggs '. 80 % of places make you pay for substituting the meat for vegetables:",1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment
"This Mexican restaurant in Penrith is a great find. We decided to try their set menu, which was delicious and more than enough to satisfy our group. I highly recommend their ceviche, fried chicken, and watermelon salad. Best enjoyed with their classic margarita. The only hiccup during our visit was the wait time; we waited for over 40 minutes for our reservation. The hostess was apologetic, and we understood that our group was quite large, with other big parties in the restaurant. However, some improved reservation management could enhance the overall dining experience.",1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment

"Staff do n't seem to care anymore. Manager serving people the day I visited does n't have service skills at all. I did not see anyone smile on anyone. There were 3 napkins on the floor I watched that no one cared to pick up. We used to get in trouble with this. We used to get trained to do a 2-part greeting and farewell. Sadly, since the kiosk was introduced, staff became a robot, too. I used to love working here and was proud of how great it was. But nowadays people only work for money and no fulfilment. I'm leaving feedback hoping that I can still be proud to say I used to work here.",0,en-AU,Google,Sentiment
"I found this restaurant by the recommendation of a Nepali friend. So I gave it a try. We ordered, Samosas and a fried chicken sausage for appetisers, and they were pretty good And for mains, the fried rice was unlike any I had tasted before, and the Bamboo Jhol Momo offered a new culinary experience in Adelaide. While the Pomegranate Mojito was refreshing, the Khukuri Katta cocktail was a disappointment as it served warm and tasted overly syrupy that was overpowering, which I did n't enjoy at all Everything was good except for the live music going on, which was overly loud for a small venue, and it kills the entire vibe of having a decent meal at a restaurant. We had to talk loud among ourselves to have a conversation! The portion sizes are average, and the prices are reasonable for a CBD restaurant. The service could also improve a bit, but nothing really bad. Overall, it was a good experience, and I hope to go back to try their",1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment
"Friendly, super fast service. Ordered a piece of snapper and the calamari box, which was 6 big strips of calamari perfectly cooked in a crispy thinnish batter. The large piece of snapper was also perfectly cooked in the same crispy batter but was a bit thicker in places. The serve of chips was on the smaller side, but the size of the snapper fillet more than compensated especially at only 11. Fabulous bargain for great tasting fish.",1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment

"The coffee is exceptional here. Like next level. Beautiful flavour, expertly made, and very nicely presented. It an all round winner that emphatically underscores the view that you can get great coffee in regional areas. Nice egg and bacon roll here. A generous size with a good amount of egg and bacon. The tomato relish was a little too sweet for me though and it was so liberally applied that it oozed out the side of the roll with the slightest pressure. The chicken and pesto roll thingy was a tiny bit disappointing for me-I found it a bit bland and over complicated-but not so for my partner who enjoyed it. It not cheap here but it all good quality. The cafe is small and it nicely and fashionably set out in the urban hipster style with some good tables on the street. It was doing a very brisk takeaway trade while we were here and plenty of people were on the outside tables too. The staff were young and friendly and doing a good job in an amiable way. It a good place. Coffee is taken ultra seriously here and it a highlight. Most city places do n't make coffee this good.",1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment

Dropped in here for lunch after a long drive Food was fantastic and very authentic Malaysian. We over ordered but had n't had breakfast. Do n't expect flash surroundings. This place is in a commercial building at the back of a shopping complex and is more Asian cafeteria style than restaurant but the food more than compensates.

One thing I would have to pick on is their attention to detail, as we asked for a very mild curry but got a very hot curry instead.

"The last time I went here was when I was on holiday in 2016. 8years later I returned yesterday as a resident of Perth. The place has n't changed in that time, in terms of decor and food. Had plenty of tables inside, outside, upstairs, downstairs, with tables on the balconies overlooking the harbour and boardwalk. A menagerie of people frequent the place, so you'll see a diverse group of people. Inside has a rustic charm and when we walked in, the queue behind me, continued outside. In saying that, the queue dropped very quickly and our food came in a timely manner. For those that do n't like seafood, there are other options. Drink options are non-alcoholic or alcoholic depending on your preference. Suggest you grab the menu while you're in the queue and if you're with a group find a table and take menus with you, decide what you want then go order. If you want your food done a certain way, let them know, they're very accommodating and You wo n't be disappointed.",1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment

Ordered a chicken roll which you would usually expect to have mayo & stuffing on and perhaps cheese. We got plain chicken stuffed into a roll that was bland. Though both the roll and chicken were Cleary fresh. The chips were decent but nothing special, and quite a large portion. We got a small which was huge. The drinks fridge was poorly stocked and our preferred drinks were all out of stock forcing us to pay extra for an upgrade size which was still not our preferred drink but better then than van options.

Food was satisfying but the difference in dough between the garlic bread and pizza was a shame( or cooking style ? I do n't know). Either way the garlic bread was perfect and soft but the pizza was crispy and dry. If the pizza base was as soft as the garlic bread this would be easy 5 star. The cocktail was nice but a bit heavy on the soda I think as it was a bit watered down and the flavour went fast Good value nevertheless, would probably pop in for garlic bread and a drink.",1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment

I ca n't fathom why a pub would not want to serve food in their most popular area on one of the busiest days. To start off with, this is against RSA best practices and will almost certainly lead to more alcohol related incidents. In addition to this, they would have lost revenue and customers by not serving food where they were enjoying the venue. It's a great venue otherwise but this really let down the experience today.",0,en-AU,Google,Sentiment

"Stayed at the accompanying motel overnight which was excellent. Had breakfast at the bistro the next morning. The initial welcome into the bistro was a bit indifferent . but some of the staff seemed friendly others did n't. I had granola with yogurt, a banana smoothie and a latte. The granola and banana smoothie( with syrup) was just ok. However the coffee was n't great  it had a very harsh bitter initial flavour . it was so bad i left it unfinished. My companion had waffles and a mango smoothie . the waffle( looked like store bought) and was very dry and crumbly. There was a small smear of cream and a few lines of syrup over them adorned with maybe one strawberry. The mango smoothie had NO mango taste whatsoever they did try to rectify by adding more mango but still no flavour . maybe they should taste their mango mix. Overall a bad experience at this place which is a shame because the motel is great.",0,en-AU,Google,Sentiment

"The bundaburg Services Club is a place of nice music and wonderful workers as well as good prices for their food and services, unlike other establishments. The drinks were well made, and the bar workers were quick and efficient in their work. The woman behind the counter was wonderful and fast at taking orders. The view from the windows out the back had a gorgeous view. However, the plastic plants added to the look from upstairs near the bar but took the nice view from below and made them look out of place aswell as they are strict on their clothing policyno open shoes, thongs and no torn or dirty clothing. Ok, now for the important part, about 20 minutes after i ordered the food arrived at my table, the food I had, steak, chips, vegetables, and a breadroll. The steak was amazing and flavourful, but 400 The chips were bland then with salt turned from bland to impressive the odd thing, not much of a salt flavour after adding salt. The breadroll was well a bread roll it was cold but cooked and the butter was actually solid instead of liquid so plus points for that and finally the vegetables, sweet potato, pumpkin, carrot not as nice as the other food but healthy.

The enclosed park is good except it has a building that kids can climb through part of it and get out of the enclosed park which leads down to a creek. The creek is filthy with rubbish. There are good things for kids to play on and have fun. It is quiet and kept clean. There were police walking through while we were there which was great to see.

Atmosphere was a bit flat, was very busy, but no seating for anyone to wait or eat in, hopefully this will change.

The hotel was fully booked and I feel as though the room we were given should n't of been offered to guests. It smelled like dank, musty cigarette which we could still smell on our clothes in our suitcases when we got home, there was visible dust on the TV cabinet, and on the first night, our air conditioner did n't work. The next morning the Manager( who was quick to respond to our request) came up to our room to inspect and kicked the unit to get it working again. At least it worked. Not only was the hotel in bad shape, but the city too. There is a TAB just downstairs from the accommodation which attracts the wrong types of people. My son( age 7) dodged a bicycle being thrown in his direction from one of the TAB patrons who was yelling and swearing at another patron, they were about to get into a physical altercation. We crossed the road very quickly! We felt very unsafe. The city is housing many who are doing it tough and sleeping rough and on my morning walk, all I could smell was human urine.

The water park is a highlight for kids and with its open layout it's easy to keep an eye on the little ones both in the splash area or while playing on the playground equipment.

Plenty of seating, a fridge with drinks and sandwiches; order at counter and food is brought to your table. Staff were friendly, service prompt. We enjoyed a macadamia gelato shake,( him) and an iced latte( me). We shared the roast pumpkin and halloumi salad-tender, sweet pumpkin and( very, if not overdone) well-done halloumi-a great mix of sweet and savoury. Crunchy radish slices and greens were refreshing. Hot seasoned chips with aioli were crispy outside, tender inside, and a generous serving. We bought a Biscoff pot to takeaway for dessert later.( It was sweet and spicy and delicious.) We also stopped there on our way home on the Monday for a sandwich from the fridge and a cool drink. Sad to say my egg and lettuce sandwich was rather overpriced with thick, bland bread, not much filling, no ? mayo and just blaah. Hubby salad and ham wrap was better.

"Very surprised and disappointed upon arrival compared to what you read on the internet. The parking is located offsite which feels very unsafe due to unhoused neighbours. Once you finally make the 5-10 minute walk back to the hotel, it is another 10 minutes to your room. When you have severe asthma this is not ideal. I wish the parking situation was a lot more clear at the point of check out. I would have reconsidered the location. In the event of an emergency( fire) the never ending corridors and stairs you never be able to get out of the building! The evacuation plans located in the room are very hard to understand. Both bed side lamps are faulty and almost zapped me when I turned the first one on. To top it all off 2 x dogs are located in the apartment below which bark every time you go out on the balcony. Not the 5 star stay I was hoping for. The room however is large and clean and the best part of the whole experience. Would not stay here again or recommend it to anyone.

Very delicious food and very nice ambience. The only reason I left one star less is because their lamb seekh kebab as in the second photo I thought were lacking the typical Indian / Pakistani flavour. Rest of all the dishes / food was very delicious and in true taste. The seekh kebab seemed like they toned the taste down to make them Aussie friendly which is fair but I think they pushed too far and removed all spices that are the essence of Seekh kebabs. I will return and hope they improve the Seekh kebab too as all the other items were mouth watering. Thank you for having us and for the great service.,1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment
"Would like to share bad experience about how they made pizza. A well know place like them should maintain taste but different time different taste. This time I bought chicken pizza and I do n't know why they put such little cheese, pineapples and chicken in it ? ? Is it cost cutting or the staff do n't know the quantity they supposed to put in! Overal taste ok but quality we used to get before is really disappointing.

Loved the ceiling and stained glass at top of Street view windows. Very small, busy, I would say thriving little Cafe. Apparently their Chicken & Leek Frittatas are absolutely amazing, and hefty sized great looking Caesar Salad delicious also. The Frittatas and Mini( muffin sized) Quiche were each( alone, with no side salad), nice looking foccacias each. Latte & Soy Latte were both of extremely good quality, strong, tasteful cuppas.

The cinema we were in was bigger than Megaplex at South Bank for comparison. The seats were big and really comfy.

I walked past before, and thought it looked interesting and chill. The sort of place good to while away a slow Sunday afternoon  well, it did n't disappoint. We asked for a Pizza recommendation and Forest was suggested. So we chose that and a Sopressa endowed one. I definitely thought the Sopressa Pizza was going to be the tastier one. I was wrong. The Forest, was tasty, moist and different. It was very delicious. The Sopressa was fine, but it was The Forest that really stood out! Of course we ordered too much, so we took home almost the equivalent of a whole Pizza. Which tasted great the next day, too! Loved the chill, but pretty bustling atmosphere. No hurrying here, and no rousting the customers after a certain time. We loved the pizza, the layout and our first coffees were pretty good too. Four stars only because second coffees were too milky and slopped in the saucer at serving. It fine. Love the kids area. Great initiative and really extends the place for everyone. Even four legged friends are welcome here. It so relaxed. There a style of seating for everyone and an ambience that is inviting and, most importantly, when the Cafes are closed for food-Du Cane has the goods. It was a lovely Sunday visit.

"First time at Neighbourhood today. Went down with my life, little girl( 2) and our friend with 2 kids of her own. Pretty busy as expected for a new business in a good location outside of the Warragul CBD area. Greeting from staff was great and welcoming after we managed to wind our way through the tables to our booth seating. Young lady who served us was very attentive and made sure she got our orders correct by reading them back. I appreciated this very much. Our coffee came out first, I ordered a vanilla latte and was unfortunately disappointed with the temperature and the flavour. Overboard on vanilla so tasted like sweet milk more than coffee. I ordered the breaky croissant, my wife poached eggs on toast with avo and hashbrowns, and we got our little one a cookie. Cookie passed the test with our 2 year old. My wife was disappointed with uncooked poached eggs and overly seasoned avo on a single piece of crunchy sourdough. Add on the hashbrowns that actually tasted like springrolls( fry oil clean), and you have an unhappy dining experience. Breaky croissant, I have not much nice to say unfortunately aside from it was hot. Toasted closed, so it was very burnt outside and lost most of my croissant on the plate. Ca n't fault the service today, was quite quick to bring out food and the wait staff were polite, accommodating, and friendly. Finish up paying the check with a shock to having paid 7 for the cookie and a total of 55 for not a great product. Could have been and did expect a mich better overall experience at Neighbourhood today. I am debating about going back.... I think one more attempt is warranted.",0,en-AU,Google,Sentiment

"Very spiced, love it! They can do spicy if you want it hot too. Goat curry meat was amazingly tender and a joy to eat. Beef Vindaloo meat was bit tough but still enjoyable, especially with it being ' Indian Hot ' spiciness level. Butter chicken was too sweet for my liking.",1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment
"Stopped to pick up a road trip pie. I got the steak and mushroom and was very happy with the quality of the meat, no horrible gristle bits. Pastry was a little soft on the bottom so it fell apart a bit but we did get there later in the day, around 215. Overall recommend",1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment

Popped in for lunch and was not disappointed. I had the Thai green curry with 8 fat juicy prawns. It was delicious and fresh. The rice was perfectly cooked. My friend had a huge serving of salt and pepper squid with fresh salad and smooth aioli. Highly recommended caf.,1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment

"Edit: I've returned twice to try the vegan bahn mi. The rolls and salad are lovely and fresh, but again, the tofu is just so flavourless. There was also no fresh chilli. Service was great. Very disappointingly, there is a lack of vegan or vegetarian options on this menu. I tried the' marinated tofu' vermicelli bowl, but the tofu did not appear or taste to be marinated whatsoever. The sauce was nice. Until more inclusive options are added, I would n't return personally.",0,en-AU,Google,Sentiment

This dish in the picture is a large Spaghetti Bolognese and it was certainly a large portion as my wife had the regular and the difference in size is very noticeable. The quality of food was very good but not the best and delivered to our table in good time. We also had a Garlic Bread starter( no photo) and that was very nice too. The service was polite and friendly with zero faults there however the restaurant is in need of a revamp as it's a dull and dated which does n't help the atmosphere. We will definitely be going back again to try some of the seafood dishes they have on offer too.,1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment
Pepper pie-delicious but would loved a lot more pepper throughout the mince filling. Bacon cheese was great. The pastry used is more like a shortcut texture-very buttery and held up well.,1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment
Not a good experience here. Travelling through Adelaide to Melbourne looking for a quick bite to eat. The toilets were absolutely disgusting. Gag worthy. The one cistern was blocked and the one one urinal was not in good shape. Smell was horrendous. It took over ten minutes for our order to be completed. Seemingly a grilled chicken salad is not a staple order here as it took an eternity to make. Looked terrible and whilst it was being made everything else went cold. Terrible. Wo n't be back here.,0,en-AU,Google,Sentiment
Good food and place is very well set-up. They have a wide variety of food options and the coffee is amazing! Food portions were very good and the food itself was quite nice.

"Really nice dining experience, long waiting lines so do n't forget to make reservations in advance. The typical Thai food on the menu is great, but we wanted to experiment so oopted for the grilled squid, chicken salad and pad kra pow. All extremely delicious! Only thing I disliked was that the staff abruptly asked us to adhere to a strict 90 minute reservation, so we had to leave at sharp( we arrived at 6 pm). Wish I could stay for longer and try more food!",1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment
dropped in here on the way through to Orange recently. a cold and foggy drive over the mountain. but was greeted by a warm and friendly pub just off the main road in Bathurst. it was a thursday night so the place was n't humming with people. but the service was great. and the food even better. i am an absolute lover of country pubs in particular the food. and the Family Hotel did nt disappoint. my wife ordered the curry.( no pictures. sorry) and I took advantage of the bangers and mash. a couple of points here. the sausages were clearly made at a butchers or in house. no mass production here. juicy. meaty. not much more to ask for. but there was more. the gravy on point. and as a nice little touch that you barely see in the city. mashed peas to compliment the mashed potatoes. a welcome addition. and one i want to see more of in the city. overall. happy we stopped here. could have strapped in and watched the footy. but the drive ahead still needed to be completed. well done Family Hotel Bathurst. will recommend. and will try to stop by again next time we are over the mountain.,1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment

"Surprisingly easy to navigate safely( given its size), Victoria Square Tarntanyangga is a gathering place as much as it is an artery for movement through the city. Many events are received and / or hosted here( including sports events and holiday festivals). The parks are nice and many people recreate; partaking in health, fitness and family activities throughout the day. Victoria Square is a place of respite for busy office workers and it can look stunningly beautiful. More native vegetation would be appreciated but the open spaces must be preserved for practical reasons. One other thing worth noting is the cooling effect of this green open space. It is significant and airflow is definitely increased within the city because of it, which is important because Adelaide is prone to hot summers.",1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment

Anyway, the beef burger was great and I'm glad to see a lot of local produce being used.",1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment
"All was wonderful. The meat is to devour. The gyros wrap is a generous fill of flavour. With the venue, some of the earthy woodwork could do with a polished stain, but that is just my preference, as it just looks like it has been quickly slapped together. That is just my perfectionism. The bar area with the lights set the feeling of something special in a relaxed greek island vibe. The staff are prompt and professional. Most of all, it looks clean, and food handling practice excellent. Music is not too loud thankfully. Ca n't wait to see the vegetarian and sweets menu that is apparently coming in the near future. Highly recommend. Such a pleasure talking to Andrew too.",1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment

Not sure if I go there again.",0,en-AU,Google,Sentiment
The waitstaff were lovely and it a cosy restaurant. They did have the aircon blaring above our table and some of the dishes were a bit salty in general but the food was pleasant and it was a fantastic dining experience! The presentation of food could be improves slightly-our scallop dish was almost completely by the rocket leaves. The pasta dish with mussels and prawns was delicious! Prawns tasted fresh and sweet. The great thing about the menu is that you are able to order half servings of the sides so you can try more dishes.,1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment
Had salted caramel and churros for two on. Service was friendly and quick. Water on the table brought out on request. I paid cash when ordering in the counter to avoid surcharge( a few days before I ordered using QR code on the table using credit card and they charged me surcharge). Salted caramel milkshake was a bit too sweet to my liking. Churros are excellent.,1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment

The garlic prawns were also really good, nice fresh prawns with not too much garlic. Fried Dim Sims were ok. The only thing we did n't really enjoy was the sweet and sour pork, not the typical dish that you would get from a Chinese restaurant.

"We waited for the food for 50 minutes, though they warned us of a 40 minutes wait after the order was taken. No mention of the long waiting times while taking us in. But that okay. But the food was not at all great. In fact, it was just okay. The bread used was hard that could n't be chewed. The burger patty was so oily and salty. The rice with Chicken curry and pappad also was bland. The Biriyani was also average. I would have given good ratings for this place, regardless of the long wait, if the food was good. It sad that the previous ratings are luring customers like me to this cafe but get cheated with the average food. Owners, please improve the quality and taste of the food. Otherwise, you guys are killing a good brand name.! Addendum: Just adding few words after the reply from the owner. Glad to see the reply that they will make things better( the owner assurance of making things better was on the waiting times. Pl note, our review was mainly on the food). Yes, it true that we did n't complain, just because we did n't want to. That does n't mean there no scope for improvement and we wanted to write a review to help those food enthusiasts.

One girl came out with an unimpressed look on her face about having to clean the tables for us which only further put me off. Not good HJ the only saving grace was the food being fresh.

I know it's shaped like sliced ham, but it tasted exactly like bacon. It was crispy and very salty, and sadly it was mostly left on my plate at the end.

"A lovely Cafe is hidden on a side street of Mandurah. I do n't like crowds much, so this was a perfect spot for me to grab breakfast and a coffee. The outside and inside of the Cafe were clean and I loved the decor and furnishings. The young man who took my order was very polite. He gave me a wooden box with a number on it. In it was the cutlery, a serviette and salt and pepper. I ordered and went to sit outside in the sun. I did not have to wait long before my coffee then my breakfast came out. A couple who ordered after me and sat at a table behind me was asked if their meal was okay by a waitress. This made me feel a little uncomfortable as I was not asked at all. Aside from that little issue, everything else was perfect.",1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment

Parmas had obviously been cooked earlier and re fried as ordered. Burnt crust, dry old looking chicken inside. One replacement parma was no better the so rather than wait again the person just left it.

It's weird cause they still offer hard liquor drinks at 11AUD per pour. Does n't make sense. The vibe here is decent. I'd say this spot is best for a day party. They have different DJs and an accepting, open vibe where everyone is accepted no matter race, religion, or orientation.

"I had a really good chai latte here with good flavour and temperature. I stayed a while with a friend and grabbed a matcha latte to takeaway at the end of my visit but it was n't very hot unfortunately, but was made by the same lady. Hot drinks are a reasonable price at for a large. No discount for bringing my reusable cup but a good price nevertheless. The Eggs Benedict and the other food all looked amazing-quality ingredients and well presented on the plate. The date brownie dessert from the fridge was nearly 8 for quite a small piece so I passed-but it looked delicious. Prices in the fridge would perhaps entice me to buy something next time. I like to know what I'm buying and how much it will cost me without having to ask the waitress about every item I'm interested in and hold up people behind me by taking up the staff valuable time. The beetroot latte sounded interesting. Service was friendly. Beware of the European wasps out the back which go for your food / sugary drinks and buzz around you. We moved inside and thankfully they did n't follow us. I would like to suggest they get an exterminator to find and kill the nearby nest of this aggressive, introduced species of wasp. Air conditioning was comfortable, as was the booth seating. It is dog-friendly out the back. Plenty of street parking in the area.

Their fluffy hotcakes were beautifully plated with fruits, nuts, coconut flakes, edible flowers and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. This was topped with a generous amount of custard which made the hot cakes a tad too sweet for my liking. The malteser shake could not be finished as it was too sweet for my liking.

"A lovely little Italian-we arrived without a booking and managed to get a seat, but I recommend booking beforehand to ensure you get a spot as there are n't many tables at this restaurant. The staff are welcoming, although we did feel a little rushed to order. The food took quite a while, but it was delicious when it arrived. We had a white pizza( essentially cheesy garlic bread), I had salmon fettuccine and partner had a creamy marinara seafood spaghetti. They were well presented and well cooked-for me personally, a little too much lemon used in my dish but by no means made it unpleasant. We also had a couple of glasses of red wine which was really nice. The atmosphere was lively and inviting. As well as eating in, they offer takeaway and there was a steady stream of customers coming in to collect orders in the hour and 30 mins( or so) that we were there, so it obviously a popular spot. Toilets are out the back of the restaurant, which felt a little strange to get to-you go through a door from the main restaurant and into a sort of courtyard where there a lot of restaurant items but the facilities were clean and well kept. I recommend to go here, lovely food and atmosphere and relatively well priced.",1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment

The Chili mussels were kind of small and did n't quite make it to "" perfect "" level despite a tasty and nicely hot sauce. The arancini balls were smushy inside, instead of distinctly "" risotto-like "". The garlic prawns were to die for... tender, plump, huge and tasty. But the thing that really intrigued me was the salad, which was "" bean, heads of broccoli and peas "". A quick read of the menu seemed to indicate that these three are the only green vegetables the chef knows how to prepare. They appeared on the other menu options. As my hubby says..., broccoli and peas must have been cheap this. There was nothing wrong exactly. All the food was tasty and well-presented. There was just something undefinable missing.

Two of us eating one will literally enjoy almost anything he's fed and neither of us really liked any of what we ordered because of the sauce. The mushrooms, prawns and fried chicken all had this sauce that had a golden syrup type flavour. It's a real shame because the mushrooms were incredible as were the prawns but they were ruined by the sauce. We were going to stay for a main, but we're nervous that sauce would be on the main as well( it was n't on the gyozas and they were absolutely lovely but again, the sauce it did come with was a little odd). Edamame was underdone. Would have given five stars except for that strange sauce. It all looked delicious too.",1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment

"This outlet is in the same location as the now defunct 2TG Thai was located in. Convenient location at Red Edge, no issues with parking. Food-BIR style curry that's prevalent in Australia( standard curry base which is built upon to order). Beef Bhuna with garlic naan. The flavour profile of the Bhuna was quite good-heat was on point and well spiced. Texturally sound as well( I dislike overly smooth gravies, which this fortunately is n't). Cumin forward on the flavour profile( quite dominant). Whilst not exclusively an issue with this outlet-Bhuna is a dry curry and I wish it was n't served drowned in gravy. Maybe this is what other customers prefer-I like to fry in a kadahi with minimal liquid. The naan was a little disappointing, lacking the smoky tandoor flavour I'm used to, and there was n't a pronounced garlic flavour. Service-absolutely lovely. Both the lady serving and the gentleman in the kitchen were smiling and welcoming. Atmosphere-what I would expect for a small Indian outlet. Clean and well attended to.",1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment

Asked if food was ok before we even took bite & constantly interrupted. If there was a time limit no one communicated this with us. Really made the whole night a very uncomfortable, rushed and stressful experienced. No ordering extra drinks or dessert. Food was excellent as always. Experience and Service horrible. After supporting this business since it opened I do n't feel like dining in anymore. I paid over 150 just to be rushed out the door and night completely ruined. ACCESS Is not all abilities accessible, difficult access with low steps into the building, very crowded with furniture inside making it difficult to navigate with mobility equipment.

"Wow, what an experience. More than an hour wait for our breakfast but we probably need to take some of the blame as we ordered an extravagant menu choice of bacon and eggs with a hash brown. No greeting or instructions, so we grabbed our own table and waited. Fifteen minutes later it was obvious that we probably needed to get our own menus as there were none on the table. Menu collected and choices decided, went to the counter to order and still no greeting apart from a couple of grunts whilst coffee was being made. Order provided and more than an hours wait for food to arrive. Underwhelming at best. Packaged butter placed on the balsamic glaze to make the experience all that much better with sticky fingers. Buttering the toast was an experience as there were more holes in the bread than bread. A request for salt and pepper was met with a look of distain. Again, I should have trusted the chef in such a quality establishment to season the food sufficiently. Bacon was ordinary, hash brown flavoured with three month old oil but my poached eggs were near perfect, hence the two stars. One for each egg. Do yourself a favour, go around the block and take advantage of Maccas or Hungry Jacks. At least you know what you will get there.",0,en-AU,Google,Sentiment

However, moving to the negative, dishes are on the small side, my kids and wife( not big eaters) asked to stop at a bakery after our meal as they were hungry. We also felt quality of food could have been much better. A few examples:-The cinnamon toast was flooded with butter, we could n't finish it.-Poached eggs on the Benedict were over cooked( like hard boiled egg)-Dishes were all super basic in execution, an average home cook could have easily done a better job. To top it all, we set outside in area which was nice enough but swarming with flies.

We have stayed at the hotel several times over the last 20 years and unfortunately this time was the worst and as such we will not return in the future. The pool was not heated and whilst it was open was not tolerable due to the intense cold temperature. I noted only a couple of kids who braved the water whilst we were there. We did try and lasted only a couple of minutes. We deliberately booked the hotel due to the indoor heated pool over an Airbnb house as we both have medical conditions in which we need to regularly rehab in the pool. The one time we did brave it we were in more pain when we got out. Additionally the bar fridge made so much noice that at night we slept with the tv on to drown out the noise of the fridge. Our room was cleaned daily however was not vacuumed the entire time we were there as dirt on the carpet was there when we arrived and there when we left. Overall a very disappointing experience.

However Ace uses thicker tortilla wraps so they do hold together better than other places in dalby.

I would never order it again, far too plain and boring. The customer service was excellent. The only issue I noticed throughout the night was that everyone in the restaurant that had ordered pizza was waiting for their meals for a while, which was really annoying because most people came with their partners, so whoever ordered pasta would get that first, and then whoever ordered pizza would get it 10mins later-which defeats the purpose of eating together at a restaurant.

My take away from my visit to this museum( that stands on the site of the first governor house that was built by Governor Phillip-the first governor of Sydney and the man that led the first 11 ships to bring convicts over from England) is this: if every other Governor and leader had behaved like Governor Phillip to the indigenous people then we would have avoided much of the pains that followed in the colonisation of this island.

All the pasta dishes were absolutely amazing, possibly the best pasta I ever had. One of the people from our party said it might even be the best meal she ever had. The deserts were lovely, but I do n't think it is necessarily worth the price. As a whole, it was an expensive meal but I would say it was worth the money for a very rare visit to a fancy place. Just be aware of the price of water: 12 a bottle. The normal table water was warm and just did n't taste good, which I never experienced before. That forced us to get still water, which was what ended up costing more. Other than that, it was an amazing visit and I will be going back again when I get the chance!",1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment
"on this one. Food was good but not great. Steak was nice. Zucchini side was disappointing. Wine markup is high( 20 local wine was 70). Service is where they struggled-not what I expect from a venue from a well-known chef. Staff were inexperienced and there did n't seem to be enough of them. A queue formed of people trying to pay bills at a computer situated randomly in the middle of the dining area because the staff were n't keeping up with clearing tables and bringing bills. Location is odd-upstairs at a hotel which brings a mix of people there for an upmarket dining experience, and others there just because it the hotel restaurant.

Great food considering it is Pizza. Staff are friendly. My only complaint is that they put anchovies as the last ingredient on the Capriciosa description which makes it unable to be read unless clicked on.

"The food here is decent and so is the environment. Generally everything I had here has been good but in this review I be discussing these particular dishes on this particular day. The prawn pasta was good however it was much more watery than I prefer. Personally I like the sauce to be thicker and have a more concentrated flavour, but that just me. The prawn to tomato to pasta ratio was pretty good though. The steak sandwich was a little underwhelming considering how good it looked. The meat was n't as warm as I liked and the caramelised onions were n't as flavoursome as they looked to be. Overall you could n't taste much else and the sandwich( 22 I think) was only half a sandwich. Would have liked the whole thing for that price. The chips were perfectly crunchy and fluffy however they were so plain. Tasted like there was n't any seasoning at all on them. A jug of lemon-lime and bitters was pretty worth it and if say that the food is usually better. Will have to write another review the next time I visit.",1,en-AU,Google,Sentiment

Ordered pizzas on Friday night with a group of friends. Placed order at and was told it would be delivered within 35 to 40 minutes. At I phoned again asking where our order was. I was told they had a delivery issue with their delivery crew and that the pizzas would be delivered within the next 35 minutes. What a joke. We finally got our delivery at which was nearly cold when we opened the boxes. I agree with previous reviews by people that they are cooked when you order them and then they sit somewhere until they are delivered. I would not be recommending Domino delivery service to anyone and certainly wo n't be using them again for entertaining visitors or friends.

Apparently there was a flood recently so there is a bad smell-a bit like urine.

Whilst this is n't the hostels fault, they make no effort to even warn you about this as I would have tried to get to sleep before the roadworks began if warned, they could also do things like offer free earplugs( I had my own but this feels like bare minimum, you can still hear the roadworks clearly through them) or just acknowledge it in some way! Windows are also not fit for purpose so do nothing to reduce the noise.

"I recently visited Butter Factory and unfortunately, my experience was quite disappointing, especially with regards to the Korean chicken and lemon squid dishes. 1. * * Korean Chicken:* * The Korean chicken dish lacked the authentic flavors I was expecting. The seasoning was bland, and the texture of the chicken was not as crispy as I had hoped for. It seemed like it was either undercooked or not prepared with the proper techniques to achieve that signature Korean chicken taste. 2. * * Lemon Squid:* * The lemon squid dish also fell short of expectations. The squid was overcooked, resulting in a rubbery texture that was difficult to enjoy. Additionally, the lemon sauce lacked balance, being overly sour without the complementary flavors to round it out. 3. * * Pricing and Portions:* * One of the most significant drawbacks of my experience at Butter Factory was the pricing combined with the portion sizes. The dishes were quite expensive considering the quality and quantity of food served. The portions were notably small, leaving me feeling unsatisfied and not getting good value for the money spent. Overall, while the ambiance of Butter Factory was pleasant, the food quality, particularly the Korean chicken and lemon squid dishes, did not meet expectations. The pricing, coupled with the small portions, further detracted from the overall dining experience. I hope the restaurant takes these criticisms into account to improve their offerings and provide a more satisfying dining experience for their customers.",0,en-AU,Google,Sentiment

I almost just walked out right then and there, which I wish I had done, but I was on a tight schedule so just ordered a bacon and egg roll. The food was delicious, however the roll was small, firm and quite high and the egg was cooked so just the white was set. As soon as I bit down into it, yolk spurted out and ran everywhere. Not ideal. I know that hospitality is struggling at the moment, and if I was in Bendigo I would give this place another go, just to give it another chance, clearly it is a well loved local haunt. My experience, however, was underwhelming. Good customer service will cause you to forgive a lot, and there was not a lot of it on this occasion.",0,en-AU,Google,Sentiment

"My brother took me here for lunch, which was nice of him. Our first impression was how heavy the sliding entry door was. It took 15 men and a small goat to tow it open with a rope. Once inside, the waitress seated us at our table, which was in the middle of the room. This would n't be unusual except we were the only two customers in the restaurant, aside from some rando in shorts at the bar, who left soon after. The decor is nice. The waitress served our table water, took our orders, then went and made our drinks. The food seemed to take a while, which I thought was odd considering the number of people they had to serve( 2, us). I guess the kitchen staff just had to catch up on whatever the kardashians were doing or whatever. No complaints about the food or drinks when they finally came. Top tier, served and presented well and tasted better than it looked. About the best a bundy bogan can ask for. The waitress serving us( the only waitress there) also made our cocktails. She took pride in crafting the unique house specials they offered, which, as somewhat of a mixologist myself, I could appreciate. Overall, I had a pleasant dining experience, and I would definitely come here again on someone else money. Between entrees, mains, and drinks, we racked up 240, although we were given 4 back in change for some unknown reason. It was really mysterious. Another mystery was what was upstairs.

I'm 40 and have never had a full time job. ( Well technically I have but it was month to month contracts and anyone who took a day off for any reason didn't have their contacts renewed.) 
I've been in my current job for 8 years and got denied permanency based on the fact that my shifts are irregular, and the annoying thing is the union rep agreed. Like I worked 2583 hours last financial year but because it wasn't 8 hrs a day 6 days a week, every week I don't get permanent.
Also as someone whose been casual for a while, other things have changed, like how long before a shift begins that they are scheduling something , places are literally getting calls from clients and saying yeah we can do that today for you, then ringing around staff to see whose available. It's shifting the risk/cost of business from the employer to the employee.
The law hasn't caught up with technology, I've talked to people who did my job more than 30 years ago, casual wasn't a thing because most people didn't have mobile phones, so they paid people to be on call, they don't anymore because everyone has a mobile so if I don't answer they'll try someone else and eventually someone will pickup and agree to come in. I've brought that up with the union and again they don't care.
 I want at a minimum what a friend in the US told me that they were proposing in his state ( can't remember if it went through) they were proposing a minimum notice period for temps ( what they call casuals) of 72hrs.

"Hypothetical situation:
Someone is born overseas and arrives with his parents when  he is 3 years old. He attends school through to grade 12. Later on he gets mixed up with the ""wrong crowd"" and is jailed for several years - let's say it was armed robbery. He has never left Australia - too poor to consider travelling.
At the end of his prison sentence, he is deported because he never became an Australian citizen.
In my view, he is Australian, he has no ties to that foreign country, can't even speak the language well. He has no family left in that country.
Should he be deported? Sure he's not a nice bloke, but isn't he Australia's problem?
This is the reason we should, and indeed always have in previous directions, consider ties to Australia before deporting them.

"**Anthony Carbines is under fire after admitting to being confused by a line of questioning, which has drawn criticism that he is ""either totally incompetent or intentionally misleading parliament"".**""
Police minister Anthony Carbines has been forced to admit he misled parliament amid theworsening police pay crisis.
In what is threatening to become the biggest schism between the force and the state in more than a decade, Victoria Police remains locked in abitter stalemate with the Police Associationover a push to introduce nine-hour shifts for frontline officers.
Appearing before a parliamentary inquiry on Tuesday, Mr Carbines emphatically denied being a signatory to a deed between the state government, Victoria Police and the Police Association of Victoria, in which they agreed to implement the new rostering model, which would also see officers work nine-day fortnights, providing it didn't incur additional costs or require extra resources.
""I don't think you'll find my signature on pieces of paper that relate to the parties, being Victoria Police and the Police Association, they are the parties to the deed, an agreement to commit themselves to work on these matters with the assistance and the leadership of the mediator,"" Mr Carbines said.
""That process continues and while that process is under way, it's not appropriate for the government or minister to intervene or interfere.""
But the state government later confirmed Mr Carbines had indeed signed the deed on December 20 last year, a day after the Police Association announced a ""breakthrough"".
Mr Carbines later admitted to being confused by the line of questioning by Nationals MP Danny O'Brien, a veteran of the public accounts and estimates committee probing this month's state budget.
Mr O'Brien said the police pay deal was critical to the committee's work because Chief Commissioner Shane Patton, who is vehemently opposed to the introduction of nine-hour shifts, has claimed it would add $3bn to the force's annual wages bill.
He has also warned it would force the closure of police stations and take up to 2400 police off the beat and undermine community safety  a claim vehemently denied by the police union.
""The impression I was getting from the question that was being asked was that somehow signing the deed was determining the outcome, or obliging parties on the way in which they had to negotiate,"" Mr Carbines said.
""The deed simply sets the parameters through which the parties have agreed to have a dialogue and a discussion, it was certainly not a task for me to sign a deed that directs or confirms the way in which this enterprise agreement has to be determined."" Shadow police minister Brad Battin slammed Mr Carbines, who is also Minister for Racing. ""When you have a minister more focused on horse racing than police, of course he can't explain his mistakes,"" he said. ""Anthony Carbines is either totally incompetent, or intentionally misleading parliament. Either way, he is failing those he pretends to represent.""",0,en-AU,Reddit,Sentiment

Labelling everyone as racist will often mean you are blind to the true forces underlying racism or what appears to be racism, which IMO is usually economic inequality. People in economic hardship are more easily convinced their circumstances are the result of the other tribe and race can so easily play into that (eg if you are poor, why does it make sense to vote Yes in the referendum if you perceive that someone else gets a leg up when you are doing it tough)
In this sense, this type of rhetoric is divisive to the working class who need to be in solidarity to overcome those real economic problems. You can't let either side of politics tell you ordinary people are the problem.

"You're quite wrong on all fronts, which is consistent for your take on this matter but I'll explain. Again.
Genocide is a *jus cogens* offence. As such, the Australian state cannot punish it; it has a solemn duty to prevent it but that's it. South Africa, in a bold move to distract ANC critics at home (when electoral woes were headed their way) sought to make a case for it in the ICJ, and that ruling has been ignorantly and wilfully interpreted since. 
**Our** obligation under the convention is for the prevention, though. **Not** the punishment. Some objective research would have illustrated why, and I'll have to explain it for you because of the pesky ""objective"" part.
The first jus cogens trial, for which our own Doc Evatt was not involved (but he was in UNGAR 181, fun fact), was the Nuremberg trials. Here, the new German government did not punish the old, nor did the US take the lead. A tribunal was convened with a panel of Allied judges. 
When the Rwandan genocide went to trial, it was at a UN-backed International Tribunal Similarly, when the Serbian leadership went on trial for the genocide committed in the Yugoslav wars, it was via a UN international tribunal ICTY 
This is not coincidence. It is a function of a jus cogens offence, because as opposed to the application of jus commune in the domestic courts, no state can permit any derogation from this norm nor validly punish it. In other words, you can *only* have an international legal trial. 
The right thing has happened; the ICJ was involved.

- does the facility have in house chefs making delicious fresh food, or do they simply warm up bland pre-packaged frozen meals. 
- will the facility allow residents to have their own mini fridge in their room, access to internet and phone.
- observe staff interactions with other residents when inspecting facilities. You can tell very quickly if it's a warm and caring relationship between them.

"This is an old post I've shamelessly copied and pasted that explains why this belief is bullshit 
Australian ecologist here: my god, there is a lot of rubbish being touted in this thread.
Okay, first up: there are not more dangerous animals in Australia then elsewhere. This is a misconception fueled by silliness and exoticism. The famous list of Australia having nearly all of the world's most venomous snakes comes from a terrible LD50 study that only used five or so overseas snakes for comparison. To get a more accurate impression of relative venom toxicity, check out Dr Bryan Greig Fry's LD50 page.
For the question of why we have so many venomous snakes here to begin with, one has to look at the dispersal of snakes within Australia. First there was the best snakes of all (fact), the Aspidites-- primitive snakes that branched off the snake family before pythons evolved. Australia was pretty empty with just these guys around, so when the elapids came down from Asia, there was lots of space for them to diversify into. Elapids are very venomous snakes with fixed front fangs: cobras, mamba, etc. All venomous snakes in Australia are descended from these elapids.
Australia has pretty venomous snakes because they all came from highly venomous stock. Since elapids were the main game in town for so long, they diversified to take over all niches, from super-venomous (which get a lot of attention) to nearly lacking venom all together (which no-one pays much attention to!). So Australia has a diverse range of venomous snakes, not just highly venomous ones. Focusing on the big hitters and making ridiculous guesses as to why they're here is missing the bigger picture.
The very venomous sea snakes that we have are simply land elapids that diversified into the oceans.
Our spiders are not more venomous that those of anywhere else in the world. We haven't had a spider-bite fatality since the'50s, and even then it was children and the elderly that succumbed.
South America and Africa have many more venomous species than Australia, including more venomous lizards and venomous mammals (!).

If it was not an emergency 5 years ago or even 1 year ago, it is not a national emergency now when crime is steadily falling. It's simply not possible to get to zero crime and whilst we should try to minimise crime, events will still happen like the stabbing of 5 people at Bondi: it's a tragedy, but it doesn't represent an emergency.
I believe this is all stemming from idiotic legislation on indefinite detention and equally idiotic lack of a legal alternative.
I also don't understand how the High Court can suddenly strike down legislation after years of inaction and result in a compromised security of the public as government rushes to implement emergency legislation as a knee-jerk and compromised solution. Surely the High Court could advise government of a likely challenge sufficiently in advance to permit well-thought out legislation to be put in place before striking down legislation and putting the public at risk, especially since this was about indefinite detention and nothing had been done up to that point.
Isn't the High Court also bound to minimise harm, or die on the hill of point of law?",0,en-AU,Reddit,Sentiment

"Mining:    
>The way the tax incentives are designed at the moment is a little bit concerning. The one for critical minerals allows you a tax credit for 10 percent of your operating costs, but it's available for existing facilities as well as new ones. And it doesn't have a requirement for those facilities to improve the emissions intensity of their production.    
Super Tax Breaks:    
>They probably don't involve the same degree of economic costs. They have sort of distributional consequences that are attractive given rising wealth inequality, and they do sort of reorient the intergenerational bargain, which is fraying. And so, the big one, the biggest hole is super tax breaks. So, they're costing 45 billion a year.
>It's about 2 percent of GDP. They'll pretty soon cost more than the age pension. They're obviously not very well targeted. Half the benefits flow to the wealthiest one fifth of households. I put these in two buckets. There's the bucket of things that you could probably take to an election at this point and be fairly confident it's not going to hurt you too much.
>And that is title limits on pretax contributions. It's raising the tax rate on some of those pre-tax contributions through division 293 tax that would reduce the use of super as a tax minimization tool. And if you do those, there's 3 or 4 billion dollars a year of sort of policies there that really trimming at the top end.
>And then the elephant in the room is the fact that as soon as you hit age 60, you're not going to pay any tax on your earnings. You basically had to check out of the tax system and that's costing Australians billions of dollars or the government billions of dollars a year. And that's not really sustainable in the long term.    
NDIS:   
>Yeah, look, and look, this is always the thing when you see an expenditure category that's growing faster than the economy and then a tax category that's growing slower than the economy, you know, you know, you've got something you've got to reckon with this sort of mismatch between how much we're willing to pay.
>At the outset of the NDIS, there was a really important you know, piece of thinking around how by supporting people through the scheme effectively you support them to, into employment and that's part of how the scheme starts to pay for itself. Was this an erroneous assumption or do we think this is still something that the scheme can achieve? [they lean towards it being largely erroneous].       
Housing:   
>I think that's a great question. And the issue here is that like sitting at the heart of this problem is the fact that we haven't built enough. That's why housing in part is so expensive. It's not the only factor, but it's certainly a factor that we have some control over. And if we shifted the dial on housing supply has a whole bunch of other really positive benefits for the economy.    
Healthcare:   
>As the Commonwealth faces more pressures on its budget as well, you see in the health system or in terms of disability supports, you see each government try and push the problem onto the other level of government. And so, you see you know, we, we've seen historically, the Commonwealth has tried to cut down its expenditure in primary care or in preventative care.    
>And leave the states to carry the consequences of that in terms of growth in hospitals. Or in the case of the NDIS, you see the conversation around what are some of those foundational supports that people will get in schools or other state-based settings. And as the states have less money to spend, they're going to be less cooperative in, in, in those conversations.
>And I think this comes back to the fact that Australian Federation wasn't well designed on the tax side. We've got a deep vertical fiscal imbalance with responsibilities for services sitting with the states, downstream services sitting with states, but taxation power sitting overwhelmingly with the Commonwealth.

"I'm in a strata as a renter and tbh I'm okay with it. 
During the really bad flooding situation we had a few years back, my apartment flooded due to there being no flashing at all in my external wall to my private courtyard (owners responsibility) and also the external wall that the driveway is on (strata responsibility). And I'm talking 2inches deep in my apartment removing access to my loungeroom and kitchen. Also inadequate drainage in my courtyard which helped make it even worse according to the guys who xame to fix it.
My landlord (owner) decided that because it was unprecedented flooding they wouldn't be fixing the wall to my courtyard, that it was fine and likely wouldn't happen again, while strata was prepping to fix the driveway side. This caused an argument between the two as technically strata would have to rip apart some of my internal walls to ensure the flashing was fixed and for of course... Mold checks. One of the other issues I had was my courtyard is 2ft below the road level and I only had the one drain, which wasn't effective to stop water pooling, so that + absolutely no flashing and the courtyard being under water so far the weep holes (I think that's what they called them) were under the water.. so the water only had one way to drain. Into my apartment. 
Strata ripped away ALL the walls affected to redo the flashing, including in the courtyard, had 2 more drains added to my courtyard and then took the owners to court to pay for the repairs to their part of the wall and the new drainage as my strata saw it rightly as unreasonable to not fix the other part of the issue. Took the lovely workers 3 days to do it all including repainting the inside walls they had to pull apart to fix it. 
We had a very similar flooding incident this year, strata were all over me to check the flashing was working, there was nothing coming into my apartment and even sent an inspector out to just... Check via little holes they fixed the same week. 
And look, while it was unprecedented flooding, it still was absolutely not okay for my apartment to 3xs in 6mths end up 2inches under water. And there was time between each event to fix it, clearly as it was done in 3 days total. 
Others can I guess be absolute shit shows, but not all are.
Edit to add: ours is a corporate style strata, no owners are on their board or whatever it is. They are a management of the property style set up.

"One of Australia's most frustrating failures as a nation has been a limited capacity to value-add. This country has the world's third-largest population of sheep  behind China and India  but much of the Australian wool-clothing we wear is imported, such as men's suits from Italy. There are a multitude of similar examples. Why is it so difficult to add value here, to become an exporter of finished products as well as raw materials? The excuses typically offered are that our labour costs are too high, we don't have the necessary skills, our design and managerial systems' capacities are limited or deficient, among a host of others. While there may be some elements of substance to these arguments, it is probably more relevant to blame a failure to create a deliverable national strategy for industrial development.
The Coalition's usual response has been that such development should be left to the market; however, the government has a responsibility to set the framework for where those market forces should be encouraged to operate to their best advantage. The Albanese government's Future Made in Australia (FMIA) strategy should be seen as an attempt to meet that responsibility. One important feature of the latest budget was that it provided some of the detail and commitments of such a national strategy, recognising that this country's transition to a cheaper, clean energy future, and possibly into a global energy superpower, is the most significant industrial shift to come.
A key element of the FMIA package so far is the National Battery Strategy launched last week. Of course, the visionless, destructive and denialist opposition remains content to argue that the focus on renewables leaves this country without a capacity to ensure baseload power. They claim renewables don't work when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow  ignoring the potential for cost-effective energy storage from these sources. As Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen points out, this country learnt how to store water when it doesn't rain all the time, so why not sun and wind power?
The battery strategy sets out a ""vision"" over the next decade, in which Australia becomes ""a globally competitive producer of batteries and battery materials, providing secure and resilient battery supply chains, delivering affordable and secure energy for Australians, boosting productivity, and creating wealth and opportunity while being part of the global energy transition"".
We certainly have the minerals in abundance, in a strong resources sector, as well as manufacturers' know-how, sufficient trading partners and skills capacity in our workforce. The government has now provided the necessary framework and identifies certain financial commitments. We just need to get on with it!
The global battery industry is dominated by China, whose market share is estimated to be as high as 75 per cent, although there are other significant players such as Japan's Panasonic and others that may be ripe for joint ventures. I recall an early statement by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who said he didn't want his electric vehicle company Tesla to be dependent on the Chinese for batteries. Is there potential here to become a battery supplier to Tesla? The scope for a battery industry in Australia is enormous. A particular focus domestically is achieving grid-scale and community storage, beyond the expansion of mining critical minerals. I have been struck that the usual list of these minerals often excludes graphite, as Australia is one of the few politically stable countries with significant reserves of natural graphite, which would seem to be an advantage, as natural graphite has superior heat-storing capacity. Most of the graphite used globally is synthetic, and mostly manufactured by the Chinese, using a dirty and energy-intensive heating process to convert petroleum coke, a residue of the oil refining industry, to synthetic graphite. I am also aware of an Australian-patented technology that uses a self-contained chemical process, with no wastage, to refine natural graphite, removing ""impurities"" such as iron and silica, and further improving the storage capabilities. Miners can also market these byproducts, providing additional income streams to the straight sale of the graphite.
Our graphite industry has enormous untapped potential, which should be released by the government's battery strategy. An important related point is the potential of graphite-based thermal storage has been largely ignored in Australia, as the process of concentrated solar thermal became too expensive and, in part, because of the fad-like attraction of pumped hydro. This technology has also turned out to be more difficult and expensive than anticipated  note the cost blowouts and tunnelling difficulties of Snowy 2.0, the mother of all pumped hydro projects, which, as I pointed out in an earlier column, didn't stack up on a rigorous cost-benefit analysis.
The potential advantages of graphite-based thermal storage for grid-scale and community batteries ought to be more widely recognised. Consider the possibility of a new housing development with a community battery, fed by each of the houses having solar roofs rather than just solar panels. This would enable each house to draw electricity, and hot water and hot air for heating and cooling, even for cooking, as required. These homes might never again receive a power bill.
Thermal storage also opens the possibility of generating steam at the desired temperatures, which would be significant for industries such as processed food, cement, and even steel making.
There is an important distinction in grid-scale storage systems between electric batteries and what is known as load-shifting batteries. The Hornsdale Power Reserve battery that Musk built in South Australia is an electric battery that really only provides short-term back-up to variations in power supply, whereas a load-shifting battery stores the sun or wind energy when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing to be drawn down in evening and morning peaks, for example, guaranteeing dispatchable or base-load electricity.
The recent budget committed a significant amount of new money to fund the government's battery strategy. Specifically, $523.2 million for a ""battery breakthrough"" initiative to help manufacturers build capacity in crucial areas with a focus on ""high-value battery products"" that align with our areas of advantage and support the climate energy transition. There was a further $20.3 million for building future battery capabilities to develop skills and expertise, $5.6 million to deliver an ""Australian-made battery precinct"" in partnership with the Queensland government and $1.7 billion for a Future Made in Australia innovation fund that will support innovation, commercialisation, pilot and demonstration projects and early-stage developments in priority sectors, including development in battery technologies.
The implementation of this battery strategy will need careful coordination, both domestically and internationally. In Australia, state and local governments must collaborate, along with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and private financiers. These efforts may also need community action plans, including for First Nations communities in areas where there is potential for expanded mining developments. Internationally, it will be important to work and trade with both the United States and China. Efforts must be made to avoid being swept along with the US's anti-China strategy and possibly to demonstrate a willingness to work with China, where there are advantages in terms of both technology and money.
Of course, an important issue that will inevitably arise is the need for effective taxation of those who gain approvals to mine the critical minerals. The overarching need is to recognise these are national resources, the mining of which should be to the benefit of all Australians. As easy as this is to say, the past attempts at introducing a mining tax under the RuddGillard governments demonstrated just how easily this basic requirement can get lost in the melee of dealing with the mining industry.
Whatever happens, this engagement with the private sector needs to be dealt with effectively moving forward. In summary, the government's battery strategy is both a visionary and a realistic response to the challenge of taking up a leading role in the inevitable global energy transition.",1,en-AU,Reddit,Sentiment

"As a niche-interest protest party, the Greens care little about the impact their hardline positions would have on ordinary Australians. The undergraduate and destructive stance taken by Greens leader Adam Bandton the October 7 terrorist attacks byHamas against Israelis proof enough of the harm the far-left party poses toAustralia's community cohesion
The inflammatory detour into foreign policy is calculated to embarrass Anthony Albanese but, as outrageous as the anti-Israel stand is, it is only part of a bigger threat that the Greens represent to our national identity and good government. When allowed to get close to the levers of power  as they did in de facto coalition with the Gillard Labor government, and with a balance-of-power position in the federal Senate today  theGreens are exposedfor the wreckers they are.
The Albanese government has yet to prove it has the substance to stand up to the Greens. Its record to date is one of being too eager to cut a deal or shy away from a fight. Good policy  most recently legislation to give certainty to the offshore gas industry and discourage unjustified lawfare attacks by protest groups  has been put on ice to appease the Greens. Changes to the nation's environmental laws have been delayed because it is too difficult to find a sensible way to allow development and protect the natural world, something business supports.
Labor already has said it will delay introducing legislation for its $13.7bn package of production credits for hydrogen producers and critical minerals processing announced in the federal budget to allow time to negotiate with the Greens. Whatever one may think about the Albanese government's corporate subsidy agenda, the Greens will only make it worse.
The Greens have pledged to use their balance-of-power position to frustrate the government's wider agenda. This includes housing, where by focusing on renters the Greens have outflanked the federal government electorally in its inner-city seats. Voters must heed the lessons of the minor parties. For all the high ideals expressed before the last election, the teals have failed to make an impression.

How can domestic violence be a valid priority when more women and children die on the roads, if indeed death is the primary determinant of the program?
I'm assuming they mean women in Victoria rather than Victorian women (from the Victorian era) none of whom are still alive.
It's deceitful to blather on about number of deaths of women in domestic violence as justification, when more women die in other arenas, in order to support a program that aims to reduce domestic violence of a wide range of forms including raised voices.

"TL:DR 
Get financial advice asap. Yesterday would be better. 
Centrelink are useless. 
Quality of care varies from day to day. Visit and be your mum's advocate. 
I was the same as you, and retired as well, with hours on my hands each day. Both mum and dad went in together, owning their home and with some cash investments. It's a nightmare!
Here are my pro-tips!
*If your mother has assets like a family home and money in the bank, then pay for financial advice from someone who specialises in the field. They will do detailed scenarios and calculations which will let you determine what you need to do financially. It may be to sell the house, it may be to rent the house and pay interest costs etc. 
From memory it cost about $3500. 
They also offered an annual fee of $1500 or so to deal with all the Centrelink and nursing home stuff that occurs each year. I knocked that bit back. How hard can it be? Dumb decision, at least for the first 12 months. 
*Centrelink have no idea. I repeat, they have no idea. And just when you think you have it sorted, you realise again, that they have no idea. 
You will need to spent hours on the phone waiting, and days and weeks and months following them up to make sure that they have got things right. 
Because I had financial advice I knew what mum and dad should be paying, 85% of the full age pension plus $25 a day each in means tested care fees. It took me 13 months of dealing with Centrelink to get to that stage. We are finally there. 
I actually had to tell them what they were doing wrong each step of the way. But actually getting them to fix it was a nightmare. 
I've just paid $8000 in back fees even though they are the ones who messed up. And let's not forget the 6 weeks where they charged $168 dollars a day each because someone added an extra zero when inputting the nursing home deposit. There is a significant difference between a deposit of $550000 and $5500000 when it comes to fees! 
*Aged Care - family visits are a must. If staff know that there is a chance that someone may pop in to see your mum, I can guarantee that she will be cared for in a more timely manner. 
Homes are short staffed, overworked and subject to so much red tape that it's surprising that they function. Even the best ones have good and bad days depending on which staff are available.

Be your mum's advocate. That's the key word. Use it when you speak to management, which you will,  I guarantee. It's enshrined in the aged care charter of rights.

Nuclear power is expensive, it might stack up against coal but it's absolutely hopeless compared to pv solar.
Off shore wind is just absurd and the Bowen should be accounted for his stupidity in wanting it.
Power needs to be generated as close to the use as possible.
Storage from pumped hydro and batteries is still cheaper than the alternative now.
An electric vehicle fleet would have enough storage capacity for over a day and we have never had that ability before.
Ex American warships have 150mwh reactors and have a 20 year lifespan after they are decommissioned. 
Dock one in Newcastle or wherever we need some base load. 
Might be worth considering?
We use just under 11kw per capita per day. 
That's it. 
So 10  solar panels rated at 440 watts will produce more than the country needs.
They last 30 years.
So install one solar panel per person every other year and we would have enough power. 
So realistically with the taxes we pay, no household should be paying for power. 
It just one big con job.
Thankfully I live off the grid and wouldn't consider connecting to it, it's just not worth the nonsense. 
Watching everyone power go off. 
It's a joke. The power should never go out .
Companies are quoting enormous amounts for the ignorance of people. 
I have 21kw batteries and 12 kw of solar and it cost half what I have been quoted for half the capacity so where the money goes is anyone's guess.

Each council will have their own processes for any grace periods they choose to offer, hardship arrangements, and whether or not they will reduce or waive some interest would be on a case by case basis if you can prove hardship (having a rates bill by definition means you have assets because you wouldn't have this bill without having a house, even if you are cash strapped though). Most councils publish these policies on their website, or you can call and ask for a copy.

I was going to include compassion, however a reasoning person would be aware that showing compassion to others also includes when one is on the receiving end: it's part of the wisdom in ""do unto others as you would have others do unto you"".
However, direct democracy would have to be better than representative democracy in that there are more people involved where selfishness and other vices tend to better cancel themselves out. Nothing is perfect, but better is more useful than worse or the same.
Therefore, I encourage the people of Australia to urge government in the direction of direct democracy, to start by creating an uncensored anonymous online forum for reasoned debate and feeding public sentiment back to government who is supposed to be representing that sentiment; along with an associated education program for the experts advising government to also present their expertise to the people of Australia who are already paying for it; basic facilities for every Australian adult to contribute to the forum; and reduced working hours to allow them to participate.
Freedom of speech, not freedom of action, needs to be restored to the Australian people instead of chilling discussion by punishing speech arbitrarily interpreted as hateful or resulting in hurt feelings. Speech has no meaning in itself, only in its interpretation and particularly subsequent action, which is why it needs to be free. Even the interpretation of speech is on the receiver, not the speaker: the speaker has no control over how the receiver interprets or respods to their speech, especially when the words can have multiple interpretations even if both parties have the same understanding of speech.
As for being hateful or hurtful to feelings, feelings are subjectively created and autonomously acted out, within each individual person, outside of the control of a speaker. Whilst a speaker's intent may be to trigger emotions in a recipient and acting them out in a certain way to achieve a particular agenda, those emotions are created by the recipient, for good or ill, as part of the normal function of a human being and are not the responsibility of any external party. We are not our brothers keeper.
It is therefore vital that we teach people to manage their own emotions, with reason, so that they don't take action that becomes the source of objective harm. Speech is not action or cause of action: that is always performed by the recipient depending on how they interpret and action that speech, internally as well as externally.",0,en-AU,Reddit,Sentiment

"Just gonna do the major cities in alphabetical order here:
Adelaide - has suburban beaches all along its western side (other than some small areas with cliffs and others with mangrove forest), but lies in a sheltered gulf so the surf is minor at those beaches (which is mostly a good thing for swimming, obviously). Surf beaches are about an hour or two to the south. The climate is Mediterranean (hot, dry summers, mild/cool wet winters) and the ocean temperature is a little colder. So access is good for most of the year but a bit limited in winter, unless you are a hardcore. ""5 minutes from a beach"" is very attainable in a significant proportion of metropolitan Adelaide and most beaches are very uncrowded and peaceful. It's also decent for scuba in some parts of the state where there are seagrasses and cuttlefish.
Brisbane - slightly limited access to beaches in Brisbane itself - there are much better beaches slightly further afield in the Gold Coast or Sunshine Coast, which are separate cities. Brisbane itself has a kind of ""city beach"" thing on the Brisbane riverfront area, but it's not really much of a place to swim. The climate is subtropical - generally very warm and agreeable.
Canberra - inland city in the ""mountains"", with no ocean coastline and no beaches. Climate is generally quite cool. Very poor option for a beach lover, but a lovely city otherwise.
Darwin - has beaches, but you really can't swim at most of them because of the jellyfish and saltwater crocodiles (this applies generally in the tropical north). There is a sheltered ""waterfront"" area you can swim in that's very popular with locals and tourists alike. They also have a wavepool there. The climate is tropical - easily hot enough to entice you to swim all year long. But yeah, your options will be limited and in general you'd be better off with access to a pool.
Hobart - has some beaches I assume, but it is considerably cooler than the mainland cities and so you will probably need to be selective with when you go. Beachgoing is generally not seen as a theme of Hobart life.
Melbourne - has beaches, but like Adelaide it is on a sheltered bay/gulf so the surf is poor. You can venture further afield to towns along the southern coast for much better surfing beaches. The climate is marine coastal - some very warm and sunny days in summer, but more erratic weather in other months. It's probably more than fair to say that Melbourne is not as famous for its beach lifestyle as Sydney is. Although St Kilda and Brighton Beach are quite popular.
Perth - like Adelaide, has suburban beaches all along its western side, and like Adelaide, has a Mediterranean climate. Unlike Adelaide many of its suburban beaches are on the open Indian ocean and therefore have a stronger surf. They also are a bit narrower and rockier than Adelaide beaches I think. Some may argue, but realistically I think Perth is probably the best answer for your question as far as larger cities go - weather, surf, ease of access. Although Adelaide is very comparable/close (moreso than a lot of people think).
Sydney - has very highly rated beaches on its Eastern side towards the Pacific Ocean...but so highly rated that they are invariably very crowded, which can be a hassle for actually going to them in several ways (parking/access, crowds, etc). The surf can be quite strong unless you go to a more sheltered beach. Most people in Sydney live a long way out to the west due to very unaffordable housing elsewhere, so ""being 5 minutes from a beach"" is much less attainable than it might seem. The weather is subtropical like Brisbane, but Sydney tends to be a bit prone to strong storm fronts which can present challenges for beachgoers. You will need to be very aware of things like rip tides and the importance of swimming between the flags. That said, it's hard to deny that Sydney is famous for its beaches and is internationally recognised for that fact - that's not without reason. They are stunning, and it almost goes without saying that beachgoing is a huge part of the culture/lifestyle in Sydney.
So those are the capitals/major cities. Adelaide, Perth and Sydney would be my top recs to seriously think about. You can find plenty of pics and vids online to get a feel for what the beaches look like in these places. Here are some samples which I think give you a good enough overview of what to expect in each city, but there are lots and lots of these sorts of videos floating around:
Perth (tour of general suburban coastline)
Adelaide (Henley Beach) Adelaide (Grange Beach) Adelaide (Glenelg Beach) Adelaide (Aldinga Beach) Adelaide (Sellick's Beach) - (I couldn't find a good general tour video, but as you can see there are a lot of beaches and quite a bit of variety)
Melbourne (St Kilda, Brighton) - arguably one of the nation's best (or best known) beaches, but a lot more than 5 minutes away from Brisbane. Gold Coast is its own distinct city, but much smaller than Brisbane and very much a tourist hotspot. All those buildings you can see in the video are hotels and apartments.
Darwin (Waterfront) - realistically quite often too cold to swim AFAIK...but very beautiful.
However, you might want to consider some smaller/regional coastal cities as places where you are more likely to be able to get accommodation within 5 minutes of the beach. I will list a few towns that are well known for their beachgoing lifestyles by state:
NSW - Byron Bay, Coffs Harbour, Wollongong, Newcastle
QLD - Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Noosa, Mackay, Airlie Beach, Bundaberg, Yeppoon
SA - Ceduna, Port Lincoln, Moonta/Wallaroo, Port Elliot/Victor Harbor, Robe, Emu Bay 
TAS - Bicheno, Coles Bay
VIC - Apollo Bay, Torquay, Lorne, Warrnambool, Sorrento, Bell's Beach, Geelong, Sale
WA - Margaret River, Bunbury, Albany, Broome, Esperance, Shark Bay
There are many others. These are mostly quite small places - accommodation will possibly be cheaper, but work will likely be much harder to find.",1,en-AU,Reddit,Sentiment

"Out of the options you listed, Buller is the clear pick. It has a good lift network, good trails, good town, generally has decent conditions, and good transport options. It can get really busy especially on weekends, midweek less of an issue. 
Lake Mountain doesn't have any downhill skiing - cross country only (as well as snow play). It's also very low in altitude so unreliable for conditions - if you wanted to to go there to see snow you'd have to keep an eye on the weather and conditions as it may well be sloppy or bare.
Baw Baw can get decent snow but it's a very small area with short lifts and trails. It would be cheaper than Buller so there's that. I've never been there so can't say much more.
My favourite option in Victoria is Falls Creek - IMO it has the best variety of terrain, the best views, the best conditions, and less queues than Buller. However it is too far for a day trip. For 2 nights though I'd say it's worth it going to Falls Creek. It might be hard and/or expensive to get accommodation at this late stage though. Definitely worth the extra distance though if it's possible. 
Finally - if your visitors are coming from overseas, I'd question if going skiing here is really something they want to do here. If they're coming from a country where they already ski, it's unlikely to be better here. And if not, it's likely they can travel and ski somewhere where it will be cheaper and better than it is here.

"LCD backlights have an expected lifespan, typically measured in hours. It can be a pretty wide range of hours from 20,000 - 100,000 hours depending on multiple things such as the quality of components, screen brightness & other settings, environment it was being used in, so on and so forth. Some manufacturers advertise their expected lifespans (with lots of caveats).
How many hours per day did you use the monitor? What brightness level? Was the room it was in hot or humid? Did it get direct sunlight? Etc etc etc.  Multiply the amount of hours you used it by 4 years, take off a bunch for whatever conditions, and if the number you get is significantly under the expected lifespan for your monitor, then you can argue (per Australin consumer law) that despite being out of warranty it is still a valid return because it isn't meeting the expected lifespan.

"Why would it be a career ender or even embarassing when it's a fake? The ability to create fakes makes it even more likely that what you see is a fake since it is easier to produce.
Since the only connection with a person is generally the face and people aren't usually embarassed or career ending because of an image of their face being distributed, then the known presence of fakes means the rest of the image, which is the part that ties it to being porn, is questionable. It's like an allegation that has no supporting evidence or a joke that has multiple interpretations.
Really, I don't understand this paranoia over unsupported allegations unless society is now accepting unsupported allegations as truth and punishing on the basis of guilty until proven innocent.
The prevalence of fakes and misinformation simply means you can't trust what you are superficially presented with and thus your own response to that material is questionable: you have to work harder to find the truth in order to react reasonably, or just dismiss it all as propaganda and not react, unless you like the sound of your own subjective emotions dribbling out of your mouth without any objective basis.
The purpose of porn is to sexually excite and usually it exaggerates the characteristics that facilitate that. Even if deepfake porn is produced, it's likely to accentuate a persons sexual characteristics, so once again, I'm unsure how that is such an objectively harmful thing to go all prohibition era on if you do accept the authenticity of deep fakes or if you reject them as fakes.
It's easier for someone to ignore criticism and judgement than it is to force everyone not to criticise or judge.
The issue with deepfake porn is one of subjective emotional responses that needs to be moderated with reason, rather than objective harms that usually involve physical action against someone: subjective hurt feelings are not necessarily objective harms and everything tends to impact on our subjective emotions, so should we attempt to address everything in the world that results in hurt feelings or reduce the complexity down to addressing objective harms that might even be practical? Objective harms themself must be triaged because we don't have enough resources to manage them completely, let alone adding subjective hurt feelings to the burden creating an even longer list.
Subjective emotions are at the heart of many of the laws being crafted today, particularly fear and paranoia, yet government is using fear as a deterrent in an attempt to suppress the distribution of material that it says leads to fear. How can the use of fear be wrong in the distribution of deep fake porn but right in the methods used to suppress it? The ends don't justify the means.",0,en-AU,Reddit,Sentiment

The only bit I can find:
>""We are a racist country, let's face it. We always have been and it's very depressing,""
There's no metric on what qualifies as a'racist' country or not; but it is obvious that racism has played a part in the national psyche and conversation.
The treatment of massacres of indigenous people pre 1901
The fact the first Federal Parliament passed the White Australia Policy, a blatantly racist law which remained in law for 70 years, the majority of Australia's existence up until this time
The practice of forced removal of children from parents of only one race again for the majority of the nation's existence (again up until the 70s)
Fearmongering and dogwhistling against non white races being prominent in political discourse even up until today.
Different legislation for those living in indigenous communities (like NT alcohol laws) 
On a non political level (as her comment didn't specifically mention politics only):
The vast vast majority of commercial TV and media featuring white faces. Today 1 out of 5 Australians are of Asian heritage (there's more Australians of Asian heritage than Americans of black or Latino heritage) but you wouldn't know it from watching Australian TV.
The national character and story being almost exclusively from a white Anglo Saxon perspective, with only fleeting mentions of a vague'multiculturalism'.
News media quick to label the race of a non white offender but you never hear the opposite.
News media egging on race riots like Cronulla.
Tingle is right, racism is a big part of the Australian story. Australia may not be as racist as other nations, and we may have improved the situation in recent years but neither of those facts invalidate her comments.

"I was not born in Australia and I generally like to torch the cunts who were, but you protest far too much, I think. If you were talking about violent crimes committed against immigrants, I could understand it. That's not what you're talking about here - and frankly you're a little insulting, assuming that you are for real.
Australia's level of immigration has been far too high for several years without any commensurate expansion in infrastructure. Everyone settles in Melbourne or Sydney. This has created a very noticeable decline in living standards in terms of overcrowding - not just traffic, but in schools, hospitals, etc. A lot of people don't want any more of this and it's hard to blame them. The housing situation is unimaginably horrible and it is getting worse. The amenity of living in Australia (for those of us who knew it in the mid 90s) is now gone. 
If I were you, I'd keep my mouth shut about centrelink, etc. We are living in a per capita recession as we speak and mass immigration is the only way that the government can gaslight the people that everything is cool because we don't have an actual negative GDP print(even though it feels like recession for the average punter).

"NSW Liberal MP Julian Leeser has expressed alarm that a hung parliament at the next election could see the Greens making the ""unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state and the weakening of the Western alliance a price of government.""
On Wednesday morning, Labor and the Coalition teamed up to oppose a Greens motion in the House of Representatives recognising the state of Palestine, with Mr Leeser telling The Australian after the vote that Labor needed to take key steps to distance itself from the minor party.
""It's time Labor stopped preferencing the Greens on their ballot paper,"" he said.
Mr Leeser expressed grave concern at the prospect of a hung parliament at the next election and the emergence of a Labor/Greens coalition.
""It is bad enough that Labor foreign policy is made on the floor of their national conference where they sell out one ally  Israel  to placate the Corbynites from attacking AUKUS,"" Mr Leeser told The Australian. ""But how much worse would it be if Labor allowed the Greens to dictate our foreign policy as the price of government?"" ""This is not an environmental party,"" he said. ""This is party that is obsessed with Israel and Jews.""
'What is Adam Bandt advocating for?': Labor MP questions Greens leader's announcement
Only five people supported the Greens motion, including the four lower house Greens MPs and Tasmanian independent Andrew Wilkie, while 80 MPs voted against it.
Speaking in support of his own motion in the House of Representatives, Mr Bandt said that recognition of Palestine was long overdue and was not ""just a symbolic move.""
""It is a critical step towards peace and towards ending the slaughter we are seeing with the invasion of Gaza,"" he said. ""It is a concrete step towards peace.""
""As the Prime Minister of Norway said last week, there cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition."" Mr Bandt said the ""scale of the slaughter and the genocide that we are witnessing is now topping 36,000 people.""
""A health system has been destroyed. There are mass graves in hospitals. Aid has been blocked. Children are now dying because they do not have enough to eat or drink.""
He warned that a ""human engineered famine"" was now taking its toll on the civilian population in Gaza that ""amounts to collective punishment of these people.""
Mr Bandt said that Labor's credibility was also on the line, declaring that a two state solution could not be realised if you ""recognise just one side.""
""Labor backs to the hilt a genocidal war that is destroying the possibility of a state of Palestine,"" he said. ""Labor has stood with the extreme Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu."" Josh Frydenberg slams the Greens for promoting'un-Australian values'
Assistant Foreign Minister Tim Watts took aim at Mr Bandt for the motion, arguing it was a stunt and an exercise in politics that would divide the community.
""Why he would be deliberately setting up a vote on Palestinian recognition to fail is something that only he can answer,"" Mr Watts said..
""Simplistic wedge motions in the House do nothing to advance the cause of peace,"" he said.
""Wedge politics only divides the community,"" he said. ""Anyone who is serious about peace knows that that requires a two state solution  but the Greens aren't serious. They prefer slogans to policy. A two state solution requires working together and the recognition of each other.""
""On the question of recognition, we have made clear that we will be guided by whether recognition will advance the cause for peace. Like many countries Australia has been frustrated by the lack of progress in this regard,"" he said. ""Australia no longer sees recognition as only occurring at the end of the process. It could occur as part of a peace process.""
But Mr Watts said there would need to be serious governance reforms, noting that Hamas was a terrorist organisation. ""We see no role for them in this,"" he said. ""A Palestinian state cannot be in the position to threaten Israel's security.""
""We want to see a reformed Palestinian governing authority  We want to see a commitment to peace and how the Palestinian authority leads its people.""
Mr Leeser, who spoke against the motion, told the parliament that recognition should only occur after a peace agreement with Israel had been reached and negotiations on the ground had concluded. 'End the occupation': Greens Leader calls for Labor to'take action' against Israel
""This motion  sends the message that Hamas' violent terrorist attacks, its murders, its abductions, its gang rapes, and its dismemberment of innocent children and its torture of people should somehow be defendable,"" he said. ""This motion means recognising a Palestinian State when Hamas refuses to release more than 130 Israeli hostages.""
He also took aim at the Greens, saying that it was a party that promoted women's rights and those of the LGBTI community but which was also advancing the ""cause of organisations like Hamas which are among the greatest abusers of women (and) LGBTI people in the world.""
Mr Leeser, who describes himself as a proud and public Jewish MP, also said that anti-Semitism had ""become a central plank of Green philosophy.""
""The Greens voted against the bipartisan motion that condemned the 7 October terrorist attacks that passed this House on 16 October  even before Israel had begun its operations in Gaza,"" he said. ""They refused to condemn Greens MP Jenny Leong for her comments that said Jews have tentacles and that Jews should not be able to participate in the public life of this country.""
Mr Leeser also noted that Mr Bandt, when directly asked on the ABC's Insiders program about whether he supported the idea of a Jewish homeland state, would not answer.

We just built a new house, our dream house. It's still the same feeling I had when I was 18 and had nothing. I have dreams, but they're never as good as I think they are when I reach them, because they're all surface; buy a house, run a business. The dream for me is not to sit in a house, without community.

"Two in three dollars allocated to new road and rail projects in Tuesday's budget went to Labor held electorates, sparking hypocrisy claims from the Coalition. Labor allocated $4.1 billion for 64 new priority infrastructure projects, $2.7 billion of which went to Labor seats, according to analysis of Infrastructure Department data by The Australian Financial Review.
Labor stashes away billions for road and rail projects in its own seats. Sydney Morning Herald The money for new projects was in addition to $10.1 billion over 10 years towards dozens of projects already being jointly funded with the states. The bulk of the new money, about $1.9 billion, went to 14 new projects in western Sydney. Among the cash splash was $115 million for upgrades to Mulgoa Road in the Liberal held marginal seat of Lindsay. A version of the same project was axed by Infrastructure Minister Catherine King six months ago in response to the review of the $120 billion 10-year Infrastructure Investment Pipeline.
Advertisement Overall, NSW got $2.5 billion for 23 new road and rail projects with $1.85 billion allocated to Labor seats. About $340 million was given to Coalition seats and $215 million for projects that run over multiple, mixed electorates. Queensland was allocated three new projects worth $192 million. The bulk of that went to the Labor seat of Blair for two highway upgrades worth $177 million. A further $15 million was allocated to the Liberal seat of Petrie.
Infrastructure Minister Catherine King said the government had worked closely with the states and territories to invest in the projects that needed money the most, and were guided by them to assess priority. ""The majority of our investments in this budget went to ensure existing projects can be delivered, as well as in fast-growing areas like western Sydney and south-east Queensland,"" Ms King told the Financial Review. ""The Commonwealth cannot deliver projects that the states and territories are not supportive of. We saw the outcome of this with the Liberals and Nationals announcing project after project that were never delivered."" Just over half new projects were in Labor seats, though almost half of those  14 small projects worth about $444 million  were in the Northern Territory where the party holds both federal lower house seats. The Territory's election is scheduled for August this year. In Tasmania, three out of six new projects were in Labor seats and received the bulk of new money  about $120 million of the $171 million, which was largely for upgrades to the Lyell and Huon highways. Big winner A further $47 million went to transport projects in the seat of Clark around Hobart where independent Andrew Wilkie is the local MP. Victoria received just over $17.6 million for three new projects, all of which were in Coalition seats, but was ultimately the big infrastructure winner in the budget, receiving $5 billion for 27 existing projects. That commitment means Victoria received the largest share of new money allocated to the 10-year $120 billion Infrastructure Investment Program in Treasurer Jim Chalmers' third budget, almost $2 billion more than NSW. There is also $1.8 billion still unallocated in NSW, with many new projects currently in the planning phase, and anticipated to move to construction phase in the near future. Across new and existing projects, Queensland was allocated $2.5 billion, while Western Australia received $2.3 billion, about 75 per cent of which was for WA Labor's signature Metronet train network. South Australia got $160 million for seven new projects, just $5 million of which went to Labor seats. The bulk of the money  about $136 million  went to two road projects in the independent seat of Mayo. Shadow Infrastructure Minister Bridget McKenzie accused Labor of using the budget to ""bail out"" Labor premiers and satiate local Labor MPs. ""It should have focussed on giving the Reserve Bank of Australia confidence in their fiscal approach, so interest rates can be reduced and cost of living pressures relieved,"" Senator McKenzie said.

"A private consulting firm handed almost $10 million in aged-care contracts has left providers and the federal government embarrassed after it disabled websites built with taxpayer money, delivered a 13-page final report and issued legal threats.
The saga of Miles Morgan Australia's involvement in the ""Future Fit"" turnaround project for Meals on Wheels is emblematic of a broader crisis in aged care, where departmental officials and ministers throw money at the private sector hoping to fix a social problem.
It is also a cautionary tale in contract management that has earnt the attention of the acting auditor-general, Rona Mellor.
Miles Morgan Australia (MMA) is a boutique consulting and research services firm that was owned and operated out of Western Australia from 2012 by Barbara Macnish, a signatory to the first two contracts under the Future Fit program alongside her then chief executive officer, Lakshman Gunaratnam, a former Deloitte Australia partner.
Macnish sold the business to Gunaratnam just days after the second contract was signed in December 2022 and he took control as sole director four days before Christmas that year.
Together with former Labor adviser Loire Hunter, Gunaratnam owns the company through another vehicle, Leveraged Pty Ltd.
Miles Morgan Australia's involvement with Meals on Wheels began in May 2021, when the Morrison government announced changes to the Commonwealth Home Support Program that would eventually combine lower-level care with more intensive care in a new category called the Support at Home Program.
Meals on Wheels Australia was approached by MMA with the offer of pro bono advice and the two outfits worked together on a business transformation funding proposal for the national peak body of Meals on Wheels providers. Meals on Wheels Australia had asked the Department of Health and Aged Care for $5.5 million.
The government approved but, without the knowledge of Meals on Wheels Australia, the department recommended to then aged care services minister Richard Colbeck that it should give the money directly to MMA because it had already been working with the meals network, had ""a deep understanding"" of the needs and a ""strong working relationship with the Department"".
""This puts MMA in a unique position to deliver on the Department's requirements,"" the submission prepared for Colbeck says.
""This procurement was through a direct approach (one supplier) of MMA under an existing panel arrangement.""
Despite this plain fact in the ministerial submission, which was not public information until it was ordered to be tabled in the senate by Greens Senator Janet Rice, the contract notice for the $5.5 million first phase of MMA work still states the process was conducted as an ""open tender"".
That contract was later revised up to more than $7 million. The Saturday Paper is not suggesting that MMA or any of its directors have acted improperly in discharging their obligations under the federal government contract.
Within months of winning the contract, MMA decided Meals on Wheels Australia did not have the ""capability"" for the transformation work and the national body was sidelined. Instead, some state associations were chosen to participate.",0,en-AU,Reddit,Sentiment

">The attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, said the reform would protect any Victorian who made a report to police, granting them complete immunity if their alleged perpetrator tries to bring a defamation suit against them.
Allegations usually result in the person alleged having their freedom compromised very quickly through being detained or bailed, regardless if they are actually innocent. As we have seen in other recent developments of making bail harder to obtain, the net result of allegation is effectively punishing a person in advance of determining their guilt by using the justice system process against them.
Once in the justice system, mud sticks even if the alleged criminal is proven not guilty. Until recently, innocent people could better protect themself against the effects of false allegation by taking defamation action, but this new legislation appears to block that avenue, meaning the justice system would now effectively be protecting people making false allegations.
I acknowledge the issue of people being fearful of coming forward to report crimes, however a balance needs to be struck here against the ability to punish people through mere allegation, which may also be false, in advance of a judgement of guilt.
The proposed legislation appears to effectively grant accusers immunity from false allegations.
In our system of justice, the costs of making allegations is borne by the state, however the cost of defense, including defending their reputation, against allegations is usually borne by the defendant. Part of this defense is the ability to raise defamation action against false accusation. Without that option, the defendant is subject to public slander and loss of freedom as punishments in advance of even proof of guilt, based merely on allegation. Even if proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt fails, the defendant is not compensated for the loss of public standing and the punishment already meted out by the justice system in advance of the verdict.
Whilst I understand the court has some leeway to punish an accuser for false allegations, this is not prescribed.
Justice is supposed to be for both accused and accuser, but we are increasingly seeing justice be applied in favour of the accuser, allowing false or unfounded accusations to punish the accused, regardless of the outcome of the court.
Crimes need to be objective harms of import, because our system of justice already punishes people based on allegation only, regardless of their guilt, which stretches the integrity of justice and the presumption of innocence. To also punish people, regardless of their guilt, as revenge for subjective hurt feelings would be outrageous, however many crimes are just that, based on subjective hurt feelings and not objective harms.
I urge the justice system not to keep lowering the threshold to criminal activity, so that false accusations can more easily be used to punish innocent people regardless of the court judgement.
I think society has lost focus of the principle of justice to more easily allow the revenge punishment of innocent people for subjective hurt feelings and for advantage. We have to find a better method of progressing justice that honours both the accused and accuser equally along with the presumption of innocence.
If a crime is of sufficient import and true, then it is worthwhile pursuing and if that is still having a chilling effect on coming forward, then we need to address why that is, not develop knee-jerk legislation to make it easier to punish people through using the justice system itself on unfounded or false allegation as revenge for subjective feelings.
>This perception that victim-survivors will be sued for speaking up can sometimes become a reality when they are threatened with defamation suits.
If an allegation is truthful, why would a defamation action succeed? Making a threat is pointless and has no power if it can't be carried out: that is where reason comes into the equation instead of capitulating to fear and paranoia.
However, I recognise that defamation law has severe limitations and I believe it needs to be re-evaluated along with the judicial process to return to the fundamental principles of justice.",0,en-AU,Reddit,Sentiment

"The Australian Federal Police union is threatening strike action to ""shut down"" airports and the sitting of federal parliament in a severe escalation of its dispute with the Albanese government over pay and conditions.  
AFP Association president Alex Caruana said the union had sought legal advice about whether AFP officers could legally walk out at airports and when parliament was sitting, saying members were sick of being ""disrespected"" by government. ""(We are considering) walking out at airports, walking out at Parliament House, walking out from other commonwealth assets and essentially shutting them down in order to make a point to the government and the AFP that we are serious about fighting for our pay and conditions and we want a fair pay deal,"" he told The Australian.  
Denouncing the government's latest pay offer of 11.2 per cent, Mr Caruana said he had spoken to about 1000 AFPA members in recent days and ""it's very clear they are very willing to vote yes to that action"".  
""Essentially, it would be that airports might have to shut down, parliament would have to stop sitting and certain other assets might have to come up with other arrangements,"" he said, identifying the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation and the Holsworthy Barracks as other potential locations for industrial action. ""It is a severe escalation but our members are sick of being disrespected by the government and by the AFP, and they want a fair pay deal. They don't want to be the lowest paid police force in Australia.""  
The AFPA is urging members to vote no to the AFP pay offer, which includes increases to allowances on top of 11.2 per cent in wage rises over three years.
If the offer is rejected, Mr Caruana said the union would examine applying to the Fair Work Commission for a protected action ballot order to authorise more significant industrial action. ""It's difficult for the AFP to do any strike action, or withholding of labour action, because of the implications to national security,"" he said. ""What I can say is that we are engaging some lawyers to look at what our options are in that space. ""We would consider that if we were to withdraw some labour from the airports, and we were to withdraw labour from places like Parliament House, from places like ANTSO and a few other places like Holsworthy etc, we're not actually putting the community at risk.

The NSW Coalition's most senior law officer, Alister Henskens, has been accused of displaying a ""dereliction of duty"" after he tried to rush new domestic violence bail laws through the state parliament before even reading the bill.
In an extraordinary move, Henskens wanted to suspend standing orders so the Minns government's new laws, which include the removal of the presumption of bail for serious domestic violence offenders, would pass without consultation.
The changes follow a string of high-profile alleged domestic violence offences, including the death of Forbes woman Molly Ticehurst last month.
Shadow attorney-general Alister Henskens said the Coalition wanted new bail laws to pass parliament by Thursday.

The bill had not yet been tabled to parliament when Henskens, the shadow attorney-general, argued that there was no time to waste in toughening bail laws. He later said he had seen the government's press release outlining the changes and knew the bill would not be controversial or lengthy.
Henskens said the laws had been modelled on a bill proposed by the Coalition, and the shadow cabinet had agreed to support Labor's laws.
However, Henskens' push failed when Sydney MP Alex Greenwich and Greens MP for Newtown Jenny Leong delivered a blistering attack.
Greenwich said he had been in parliament for ""five premiers, five leaders of the opposition and four different parliaments"", and he had never seen a proposal with ""such disrespect to stakeholders in this space"".
""I've never seen a greater dereliction of duty of an opposition to not even look at a bill, or greater disrespect for stakeholders to say you don't want to consult with them,"" Greenwich said.
""They want to rubber stamp something they haven't ever seen. But let me say this to the stakeholders and those concerned: if the opposition are going to abrogate their responsibility in this space, the crossbench will pick it up.""
Leong said the former Coalition government had 12 years to improve domestic violence rates but did little to increase vital funding for emergency measures, such as shelters for women fleeing partners.
She said Henskens' attempts to ram through the bill smacked of ""relevance deprivation"".
Leader of the House Ron Hoenig said it was completely reckless of the Coalition to push through the laws without having any idea of what they said.
""The bill could be to abolish the Liberal Party,"" Hoenig said.
Attorney-General Michael Daley told parliament that the NSW Police Force had requested time to ensure that ""all their systems and officers are ready to implement these changes across the state"".
Domestic violence support groups, including Say No to Violence, had also asked that the new laws be ""considered properly"" before being passed.
On Tuesday, the Minns government announced a series of sweeping changes designed to make it harder for men accused of serious domestic violence offences to be released back into the community.
At the centre of the package is a reversal of the presumption of bail against men accused of serious domestic violence offences, which includes intimate partner violence involving elements such as sexual assault, strangulation, kidnapping or coercive control.
There will also be changes that will allow bail decisions on serious domestic violence offences to be delayed while prosecutors appeal an offender's release in the Supreme Court.
A requirement for magistrates and judges to consider ""red flag"" behaviour such as animal cruelty, stalking and verbal or physical abuse when considering bail will be introduced, while courts will need to consider the views of victims and their families.",0,en-AU,Reddit,Sentiment

Post-covid there are fewer customers, rosters are thin, and venues closing down means workers are competing for fewer jobs, and they stick around even when mistreated.
A lot of casual work is taken up by visa holders like yourself, who don't have a safety net and tend to be even more exploitable, so I'm not sure it's Australian workers who are tolerant.
I think the real question is why are exploitative employers hard to hold accountable? There's Fair Work but they seem to only go after big corporations. In Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland, there's JobWatch, but they've had funding massively cut last year.

"I'll give you a quick breakdown of dating apps in Melbourne; 
-Plenty of fish; more like plenty of bots
-OkCupid; Crazy expensive dodgy dating app that matches you with 8-9 invisible profiles from Africa and asks you to pay $90 to see where they are from. OkCupid used to be a safe haven for people from all walks of life, match.com bought it and drove it to ground.
-Tinder: most users are Instagram and TikTok influencer wannabes posing in filtered photos with their tongues out drinks in their hands, asking people to entertain them. Rest are 40+ single parents with Snapchat filtered photos and anger management issues 
- Feeld; Like Tinder only worse, Lot of torso pictures, short attention span, no interest for relationships, great majority are either after hookups or they have no idea what they are looking for (this is literally what people write) admittedly there are some interesting people on Feeld but there is also so much rubbish, bots and spammers and unstable folks that you lose interest combing through shit very quickly. 
-Bumble; you are more likely to make friends there through BFF option than anything else, less bots as app is better regulated but clientele tends to be more white collar and elitists there, would you like to choose between a real estate agent with character issues or a business owner that looks down on blue collar people? 
I erased all of these a while ago, it was exhausting. 
My suggestion is that get out there and meet people through socializing; meetup app is amazing to build friend circles, don't use it to date, it's frowned upon but once you get out there you'll meet people anyway. 
There is everything from mental health support groups to mindfulness practices, hiking groups to book clubs. 
I am an introvert so it's perfect app to find my crowd, dating apps were literally torturing my soul. 
I am not single luckily, I wouldn't want to be single in this internet age, it brought out the worst in people. 
There are plenty of men in dating scene who are convinced women wants to see them naked or their private parts, and there are also women who know there are many desperate men so they treat men like trained monkeys who should roll on command, it's so toxic.

The population for 2 years has been saying to do something about immigration/cost of living. They havent gotten on the front foot and shown they are doing something. 
A bit like ScoMos fire blunder. Cost of living was a major issue and he had The Voice. That died down and he stopped tradies from coming and ramped up immigration. They had a big argument over some minor changes to taxes that everyone wanted indexed anyway. He was given benefit of the doubt and now he has come out with a inflationary budget. People are saying when is he going to do something about cost of living.
Im not saying he doesnt care or he isnt doing anything. Im talking about the spin. He needs to recover the frame that he is the one to be voted in to handle cost of living. Thats always going to be a little tough for the ALP due to peoples perception as the LNP being better at managing the books. But him leaving it for so long hasnt given people confidence. He is running out of time. Because now anything that takes more than a year like essential infrastructure to improve housing supply is too late.
Now he is done with another budget. So he only has the one just before the election left which is too late. 
Dutton has come out with a major decrease to immigration which a lot of the public perceive as being a silver bullet to cost of living (I dont personally agree). That has really put Albo on the back foot.
As I said with no budget until just before the next election he doesnt have much of a chance to reset the publics perception. The media will keep piling on with the landlord/private jet/out of touch stuff and Dutton will keep quiet. QLD a major swing state also has a crime problem and an ex police Qlder will probably do well.

">The NSW government is withholding more than half a billion dollars a year in waste levies collected from local councils, a NSW parliamentary committee has heard.
>The levy is also costing the state government money because it's incentivising northern NSW councils to send their landfill across the border to Queensland, according to evidence presented to a NSW Standing Committee investigating the sustainability of local government.
>The United Services Union says instead of the levy being used to help councils manage waste more sustainably, it's being hoarded in state government coffers.
>The union says the government collects around $750 million a year in waste levies from councils, but only invests $250 million of that back into waste management initiatives and pockets the rest.
>""The NSW Government is withholding money collected from local councils and their communities to the tune of $500 million a year through the waste levy,"" General Secretary Graeme Kelly said ahead of his appearance before the committee on Friday.
>NSW losing out to Queensland
>The USU says the levy collected would be significantly more if funds collected by the state government were reinvested into new local and regional landfill sites, particularly in northern NSW where most councils are now sending landfill waste over the border to Queensland.
>""Waste being transported to Queensland is at a cost to ratepayers and results in no waste levy being collected in some regions,"" Mr Kelly says.
>""The waste levy is supposed to be an environmental measure, but it's become a perverse incentive for some councils to dodge the levy by dumping waste in Queensland.
>""Most of the councils on the north coast from Coffs Harbour to the Tweed Border use contractors who are technically robbing NSW councils and taxpayers by not paying the levy.""
>Broader financial crisis
>The USU argues the waste levy is just one symptom of the broader financial crisis facing local government in NSW and is also calling for an end to rate pegging, echoing concerns raised by Local Government Professionals NSW
>The USU wants to see the rate peg abolished as part of a broader reform package to secure the long-term financial sustainability of the local government sector.

"Rebecca Huntley assesses the public mood for a living. Right now, she says, it is grim, and the housing crisis is at the root of it.
""You actually can't have a conversation about anything in any focus group about any topic that doesn't begin and end with housing. There is a deep, almost intractable despair,"" says Huntley, director at the strategic communications consultancy 89 Degrees East.
The way people in her focus groups see it, she says, ""it doesn't matter whether interest rates are up or interest rates are down, or unemployment is up or unemployment is down, doesn't matter if it's a pandemic, not a pandemic, GFC or not a GFC, housing is a horror show"".
To an ever-increasing extent, they see just one solution to their woes: cut immigration.
""They're like, 'We can't get ourselves out of this mess, therefore, we just need less people lining up for the rental property, less people trying to buy the house. Just less people',"" says Huntley.
It's not such a new sentiment, though perhaps not previously so keenly felt. Opinion polls have consistently shown over many years that a substantial majority of Australians want a smaller migrant intake and a significant number want a much smaller intake. One poll last year found as many as a quarter of respondents wanted zero net migration.
Pauline Hanson reeled off the results of 11 of these polls, conducted over the past six years, in a speech to parliament in March.
Of course, Hanson has been railing against immigration since she was first elected to federal parliament back in 1996, famously warning in her first speech that Australia was being ""swamped by Asians"". Two decades later, after having lost her seat in the lower house, she made a triumphant return as a senator for Queensland in 2016, warning Australia was being ""swamped by Muslims"".
In her March 21 speech, though, Hanson focused less on matters of race and religion than on the pressures of the sheer number of migrants on housing, transport, health, education and other services. In reciting the findings of various reputable pollsters, she claimed vindication. The major parties and big media had called her a racist and ignored her warnings that the numbers were ""out of control"".
""Was I right?"" she asked her fellow senators. ""You'd never admit it, but yes I was,"" she said.
It's hard to think of any issue other than immigration on which public opinion has been so at odds with accepted policy for so long. The large majority of people want it cut; the great majority of the political, media and economic establishment have ignored their concerns.
It has long been the multipartisan political position that high immigration is agood thing, enriching the nation culturally and economically. Questioning the orthodoxy has been a reputationally dangerous act, leading many people and organisations to be reluctant to share their qualms about the size of Australia's immigration intake.
Ian Lowe, emeritus professor in the School of Environment and Science at Griffith University, can attest to that.
Lowe was president of the country's pre-eminent environmental organisation, the Australian Conservation Foundation, for 10years until 2014.
During that time, he tells*The Saturday Paper*, he advocated for the ACF to ""prosecute the idea that population growth was a significant environmental pressure"". The organisation was reluctant to take a position, however, on the basis that advocating for a lower intake would be ""taken as a sort of Pauline Hanson-type racist comment"".
""Cutting migration will make housing cheaper, but it would also make us poorer  The boost to government budgets is enormous.""
So the ACF avoided the issue, and it still does today  as do most other civil society groups concerned with environmental and social justice issues.

"He claimed that by ""rebalancing the migration program  the Coalition would free up almost 40,000 additional homes in the first year. And well over 100,000 homes in the next five years.""
How this number was calculated, he didn't say. It appeared all the more dubious given his Fordham interview suggested Dutton did not know which migration numbers applied to which year, and given the big discrepancy between him and his treasury spokesman over the size of the cuts.
There is, in any case, reason to question the extent to which migration numbers affect the cost of buying or renting a home. During the Covid lockdowns, when Australia's borders were closed and net migrant numbers fell to zero, prices continued to rise rapidly.
According to modelling from the Grattan Institute, high migration does have some effect on housing costs. For every 100,000 above the long-term average, rents rise about 1 per cent. Thus last year, by this estimate, Australia's record number of migrants probably pushed them up about 3 per cent.
But, says Trent Wiltshire, Grattan's deputy director of migration and labour markets, ""asking rents have been rising 10 per cent a year. So it's a factor, but certainly not the driving factor.""
Migrants bring economic benefits as well as costs. Based on the rather sketchy information provided by Dutton, says Wiltshire, ""it looks like there would be a decline in skilled migration of around 135,000 over the next four years, compared to the existing skilled migration intake.
""Such a reduction would mean the lifetime fiscal cost from these skilled migrants not being here would be $34 billion.""
With all due respect to Grattan, it is very hard to assess precisely what the economic consequences of Dutton's proposed cuts would be, because so little detail has been provided about exactly where they would fall.
What is clear is that for more than a year, Dutton and other members of the Coalition have been fanning public concerns about the number of migrants coming to Australia, and blaming the Labor government for the influx.
This is simply not true, policy experts say. In fact, the explosion in NOM was substantially a consequence of decisions made by the previous Coalition government in response to the pandemic.
In the 2019 budget, the last before the pandemic, NOM was forecast to be about 270,000, a little above the long-term average. Instead, because of Covid, it plunged close to zero for two years.
When the borders reopened, the Morrison government made a series of panicked decisions aimed at encouraging workers, and particularly overseas students, to return.
""In 2021-22 the Coalition government introduced extraordinary policies to boost  numbers,"" says Abul Rizvi, a former deputy secretary of the Department of Immigration. ""Policies such as unlimited work rights for students, fee-free student and working holiday-maker applications and a special Covid visa.
""The message to industry was to go forth and expand as rapidly as possible and hang the consequences. So it did. Not only did universities go berserk recruiting as many students as they could, but private providers also boomed as the regulators were in no position to police quality. It was like an unregulated gold rush,"" says Rizvi.
The changes amounted to an attempt to undo the damage caused by the Coalition government's shabby treatment of overseas students when Covid hit, says Phil Honeywood, chief executive of the International Education Association of Australia.
In contrast with countries such as Britain and Canada, which provided support for overseas students to stay, ""Scott Morrison told students to just go home,"" says Honeywood.
""That caused incredible damage to Australia's reputation as a safe, welcoming study destination country.",0,en-AU,Reddit,Sentiment

"Having been proven correct with respect of the actual jus cogens offences at play in this war (CAH, war crimes) and being told by very, *very* Online people how I was wrong at it was all the fashionable crime starting with G - which the ICC neglected to indict upon, suggesting jews I mean AKSHULLY zionists! do control the world - I'm really keen to see how my international law major stacks up against people who have a Bachelor's in TikTokPoliSci from Reddit University!
Conceptually, the idea that no state's leaders can be immune to prosecution from *jus cogens* offences is one that, even in spite of the views of some states like China and the US, holds water. We have agreed that in customary international law and through some treaty law, that no state is permitted to derogate from the peremptory norms of international law - which, in lay speak, means no state can justify one of these crimes by saying that the sovereign state made it legal. The sovereign state cannot make it legal, which is the main reason why America struggles with the concept, because of their own take on Constitutional jurisprudence. The ICC sought, in a sense, to manage this by targeting individuals (the ICJ focuses on disputes between states) because generally one or more senior figures in a group or regime are responsible for the policy that leads to these crimes. Entire semesters on international legal jurisdictional theory was devoted to how the US views, and makes use of, the different types of jurisdiction in international law.
So we're getting to the intersection of the practice and the theory. In practice, the US also raised the prospect of misuse of the court's authority on political grounds, where the politics of statecraft get in the way and the court becomes a blunt instrument of vengeance, not justice. The way the ICC handled this does give that complaint some credit. For one; in trying to give an appearance of balance, Prosecutor Khan made a false equivalence by inferring that the leaders of a radical terrorist group are equal to leaders of a democratically elected state. As flawed as those leaders are, it is a gross violation of protocol to give them false equivalence and pandered *entirely* to politics in doing so. The calculus was that the pressure would be less to defy convention and equate the two than issue warrants for the likes of Mohammed Deif and Yayha Sinwar first and incur the wrath of the useful idiocy movement.
The ICC's investigators were also due to meet with officials from the government of Israel, as part of their investigations. It was arranged and never followed through on. Under the ICC charter, if a state is investigating its own for the commission of a jus cogens offence, then the ICC will defer any acts until such a time as the investigation was over. It is of course, doubtful to the point of fantasy to believe Israel would self-investigate on these grounds - but a court like this *must* be strict in its observing of protocol, if it is to have legitimacy in any meaningful sense. The US, Russia, and China all already are in opposition to the concept, which is 60% of the Permanent members of the UN Security Council. International cooperation has died for less (see also: League of Nations, and US non-involvement).
This brings us to Australia. The opt-out clause Dutton refers to exists for the US, and this situation - though it's hard to see Bibi coming here. It should exist. Dutton, on a diplomatic front, is right to suggest we avail ourselves of it. But there's a wider argument, which Dutton is missing, and that's not the first time I've had to say this about the LOTO.
Israel is right to view this war as an existential crisis. It is right to view 7 October as unacceptable. It is right to view the legions of useful morons parroting HAMAS talking points and confidently saying they're too smart for propaganda, as an existential threat as the rhetoric only gets more and more aligned to radical Islamic views of Jewish people. 
It is **not** right, however, to carry out collective punishment under international law.
Australia's correct path has been trodden by the Albanese government, despite unhelpful, performative, and stupid opposition from the Liberals and Greens alike. Reaffirm ally status with Israel. Ask Israel to observe its international obligations at law. Hold it to account as we would *any* liberal democracy that falls short of the standards, whilst also worshipping at the altar of Moynihan's Law as our left so ably does. **But also suggest that where the ICC is concerned, the legal case is valid and that Australia will only ever consider extraditing** ***after*** **Mohammed Deif, Yiyha Sinwar, and Mohammed al Masri have been locked up in den Haag.** 
There is less pressure on Qatar to hand these billionaire religious racists over, these cowards who make America's Koch brothers look lovely and secular. That has to change, and if Israeli leaders are tried where HAMAS leaders are not, it makes a mockery of the whole system. Saying as such should be without controversy.

"I drink espresso so don't really have the issue with milk, but curious as to why Soy or Almond milk incurs a higher charge? For the most part Soy milk is non-perishable stock and could be purchased in higher quantities (perhaps at a discount) and stored because it has a longer shelf-life. 
I just did a quick scan and The Alternative Dairy Co. Barista Soy Milk which claims it is ""Uniquely blended by coffee freaks and lab coat geeks for unparalleled taste and performance"" and has ""consistent texturing and canvassing for perfect latte art"" costs $37.44 for 12 x 1 Litre cartons, so $3.12 per litre. 
A litre of full cream Dairy Farmers milk costs around $3.90 and could only be stored for a short period and may at some point need to be thrown away. Doesn't it make sense to then encourage people to choose Soy or Almond by milk by offering it at a lower price because in the long run the cafe saves money and isn't throwing away stock. 
Perhaps I'm over simplifying it, but it seems obvious that if an inner-city cafe became known for selling soy, almond or oat milk lattes for $1-2 less than dairy milk lattes, it would attract more customers who want that kind of thing. I don't know what the balance of plant based versus dairy milk latte orders would be on any given day, perhaps the vast majority still seek dairy and non-dairy drinkers are still a minority but given the theme of these threads, it sounds like people would be willing to trek a few more blocks or even switch from dairy to plant based if they felt it was a reasonable deal and not too far beyond what a cup of coffee should cost. 
I will add a couple of caveats before angry cafe owners tell me I don't know what I'm talking about a I DO NOT know what I am talking about and b I have a machine at home, I load in the beans that I like, I push a button, it grinds them and espresso comes out, that's as complicated as my coffee existence gets, so I'm definitely not a customer of yours and I don't really care what the cost of a coffee is. I'm simply asking why Soy milk lattes incur an additional fee when it make sense to actually make them cheaper than dairy based lattes? I get that many moons ago Soy or Almond milk was probably a bit more exclusive but that's hardly the case now.",0,en-AU,Reddit,Sentiment

Yeah, every single person I know who has ever been a chef reached that point. It's just a shitty job - the main problem is you are working specifically during meal time. Working when you should be on a break.
A well managed kitchen recognises that and sets up a roster to protect the mental health of their staff but most kitchens are not well run. You could try to find a better kitchen but those jobs are hard to find... You could create a good kitchen, but honestly if you're burned out and over it, then that's probably not the best option. A good manager is passionate about the job and you probably can't do that anymore. Maybe in a few years you might be able to.
If you can finish your Cert 4 easily, then absolutely do that. The piece of paper will look good on your resume if not for your next job, maybe the one after that. It's worth having.
You could honestly do almost anything. A good mate of mine became a school teacher (they tried to get him to teach kids to cook... but he told them to fuck off. Literally dropped an F bomb in that meeting). He teaches maths and science. Doesn't have any particular aptitude for either subject, but he can read a high school textbook and that's all you really need (plus a relevant degree in teaching, obviously. He had to spend four years in university to get that - worked in a kitchen part time while studying)
Or, you could do what another mate did and move laterally - he's a hotel manager now. The hotel has a kitchen obviously, and his ability to manage the kitchen helped get the job, but doesn't actually work in the kitchen.
Ultimately, put your mental health first and get out of the situation you're in. You don't have to do it instantly - just start moving in that direction. You'll feel so much better once you've taken the first step, trust me. I'm in the middle of a similar transition myself (different industry though) still working the job I don't like but I won't be much longer and that's made a huge difference.",0,en-AU,Reddit,Sentiment

"Just make the tobacco the same price as in Europe. By putting such high tax in Australia on tobacco, they have created the illegal trade.  The high price means that smokers will buy illegal tobacco, and so hence it creates the market for illegal . It's the same as perfume or designer handbags. They are 5000% markup . Criminal counterfeiters can see they can make money on that 5000% differential and the difference is enough to make it worth the risk.
I like the New Zealand approach. The government also wants people to stop smoking and so they just raise the age of smoking every year. Eventually after a few decades there are zero smokers. The price of the tobacco is reasonable and so there is no market for the criminal gangs to make a profit with illegally important tobacco.

"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has shelved indefinitely plans to repatriate about 40 Australian women and children currently stranded in detention camps managed by the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria.
Two senior government sources with direct knowledge of the issue told*The Saturday Paper*that while the government had not formally decided against repatriating the so-called ISIS brides and their children, the prime minister had made it ""very clear"" that unless there was a dramatic deterioration in the security situation in and around the camps, the issue ""would not be revisited before the election"".
""Not bringing these women and children who are Australian citizens home is nothing other than a complete failure of political will,"" says Save the Children Australia chief executive Mat Tinkler. ""That and nothing else.""
Most of the 40 people are detained in Al Roj camp near the Turkish border and have been interviewed in person by Australian security officials. Four people detained in Al Hol detention camp further south have not been interviewed due to its inaccessibility to Australian officials.
Save the Children Australia is currently attempting to compel the Australian government to repatriate a group of the detainees in Syria via a writ of habeas corpus.
In November last year, Federal Court Justice Mark Moshinsky dismissed Save the Children's application on the grounds the detention of the women and children was not under the control of the Commonwealth. Last week the full bench of the Federal Court heard an appeal from Save the Children to overturn Justice Moshinsky's ruling.
""Australian citizenship has to mean something,"" says Tinkler. ""Being a child has to mean something too. And if our government cannot move to help a group of Australian women and their children from one of the worst places on Earth, then what does it actually mean to be an Australian citizen?""
In a supporting affidavit to the Federal Court, Greg Barton, professor of global Islamic politics at Deakin University, said the Australian government faced no practical barrier from the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), or from current circumstances on the ground, to repatriate Australian women and children.
""AANES, together with the United States, desperately wants the current very slow pace of repatriation to be substantially accelerated. There are no recorded incidents of repatriation being refused,"" Barton said.
In 2019, then Liberal prime minister Scott Morrison authorised the repatriation of eight Australian children from a Syrian detention camp. Many of those who lobbied on behalf of detainees in the country believe that, had it not been for the Covid-19 pandemic, Morrison would have repatriated all the Australian women and children.
In October 2022, Labor's Home Affairs minister, Clare O'Neil, announced a group of four Australian women and their 13 Australian children had been repatriated from Al Roj camp to their families in New South Wales, mostly in Western Sydney.
Last week one of those women, Mariam Raad, 32, pleaded guilty to willingly entering a Syrian region controlled by Islamic State, aterrorist organisation.
Raad, who is on bail, will be sentenced next month and faces a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison. She is the only person among the 17 people repatriated in October 2022 to face court.
Kamalle Dabboussy, chief executive of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils (AFIC), says the 17 who were repatriated in October 2022 have comfortably settled back into their home communities in Sydney. He led a public campaign for his daughter Mariam Dabboussy's return to Australia and remains a strong advocate for the repatriation of those who remain in north-east Syria.
""It wasn't a headache, I can take a Panadol for that. It was a fucking migraine, a big ugly stain on the blue carpet that spread all the way around to the prime minister's office, and the pain of it hasn't gone away.""
""They are getting on with their lives, getting engaged with their communities, playing sports, and as far as national security goes, they're doing exactly what they said they would do, which is cooperate with Australian authorities,"" says Dabboussy.",0,en-AU,Reddit,Sentiment

But within the coalition of the LGBTQIA+ I just want to hone in on the plus. That includes a group of people who identify as minor attracted persons. I would encourage all citizens and councillors to look up what being a minor attracted persons means."" Dr Brough said.*
Dr Bough then doubled down on this position in a later interview.
This was a comment made apparently in reference to the Pride Festival held in Albany and some negative community feedback received in respect of it. Once again, I don't see this as an Agenda item in the February meeting.

"It should need funding, ironically, the only people who receive funding or care are those that have developed extreme forms of illness such as psychosis, or those that have already broken the law and are now on some kind of order to be treated as a result through the courts.

Want to see an actual psychologist long term for a clinical condition indefinitely?  Once you hit your 10 sessions you pay entirely out of your own pocket.
It's a dimly lit road, it creates its own chaos and then ironically?
Even where the chain of causality is unbroken and the government is responsible for its own mess when a man stabs over 20 people, while there are laws to punish the doctors involved with medical negligence, at a criminal level, leading to a manslaughter charge... the knives are turned on the community as a whole instead. Ironically, the entirety of Queensland Health was aware who that person was hence the causality.
What I have learned is that the government is great at knee jerk reactions, and coming up with bad responses as a result.
But to be proactive, or even retroactive and to deal with the problem from where it stems from in the lack of interest in providing clinical care, or prosecuting those that allow for these lapses? That's a nigh on impossibility, even when the cases, and reasons for action are plonked directly in the face of governments that continue the harm...
I don't have all the answers but I have one, and it would start by holding the director of Queensland Health to account for the negligent homicide of 20 innocent people in Sydney last month and rooting out every bad practitioner that refuses to treat.
Maybe that's a tough road but at this point its what it deserves...
Those types of actions are beginning in the United States through civil action such as the actions into the wrongful death of Tony Timpa, but more widespread action needs to be taken and healthcare practitioners need to be held to account for the clusterfuck of a situation they themselves have created even if they claim the duress of not having enough funding.
On that note, not having enough funding never means:

"Not really. The gist of Michael West's article is what's known as the doctrine of command responsibility.
It comes about when senior leaders did not *order* war crimes, but they *knew or should have known* and stopped them. This applies to military leaders, of course, which is what McBride was upset about. But it applies to political leaders, too - since ultimately, in a democracy the military acts on the direction of the civilian political leadership. 
Just think of it this way. Let's imagine that our intervention in Afghanistan had been a stunning success. Let's say that today - because of Australia's intervention - the country is a peaceful stable liberal democracy. Do you think the members of the government of the day would want to take the credit?
Of course. So - if you're to take the credit when things go well under your leadership, you have to be willing to take the blame when they go badly. 
That's the doctrine of command responsibility. As the wikpedia article quotes,
>*The Prosecutor v.**Delali* first considered the scope of command responsibility by concluding that ""had reason to know"" (article 7(3)) means that a commander must have ""had in his possession information of a nature, which at the least, would put him on notice of the risk of... offences by indicating the need for additional investigation in order to ascertain whether... crimes were committed or were about to be committed by his subordinates.""
Returning to the article, a link within it,
notes that then-Defence Minister Stephen Smith was in 2012 made aware of allegations of war crimes publicly and within days. There is no indication that he took any measures whatsoever to investigate these claims - in fact he publicly denied them. 
The Minister for Defence is in overall control of the ADF. Under the doctrine of command responsibility, Stephen Smith may be responsible for war crimes. 
Anthony Albanese was a member of Cabinet at this time. Given that the war crimes allegations were aired in the media at the time, Albanese cannot claim to have been unaware of them. However, over the period of ALP government 2007-13 he held a variety of roles (including Deputy PM under Rudd), and so it would be arguable when, where or whether he could be held responsible. Nonetheless he was a member of a government where the ADF was suspected to be committing war crimes, and the government rejected action on this.",0,en-AU,Reddit,Sentiment

"**PAYWALL:**
Plumbers, bricklayers, cabinetmakers and other tradespeople needed to tackle Australia's housing crisis have not yet made the cut on the federal government's list of core occupations for its new skills-in-demand visa, despite pleas from the construction industry to make it easier to recruit from overseas.
As part of the government's December 2023 migration strategy, which aims to halve net migration from 510,000 within two years, Jobs and Skills Australia has been asked to categorise occupations that will be eligible for the ""core skills occupations list"".
Under the current draft, tradespeople including bricklayers, painters, roof tilers, stonemasons and cabinetmakers are listed as ""targeted for consultation"", rather than guaranteed a spot on the core skills list.
A case will have to be made for these occupations to be included, which Master Builders Australia chief executive Denita Wawn said was ""bizarre"" given the industry's ""mammoth task"" of building 1.2 million homes by 2029.
In a submission to Jobs and Skills Australia, Master Builders argues that to exclude any trade or trade-related profession in building and construction at a time of critical workforce shortages ""would be a failure"".
""Given the industry is facing chronic labour shortages across all occupation groups and has a mammoth task of building 1.2 million homes with supporting infrastructure, all building and construction trades and related occupations must be included on the list,"" Wawn said on Tuesday.
""Bricklayers, cabinetmakers, stonemasons, painters, plasterers and roof tilers are all in shortage but have all been put on the'maybe' list. If we are going to have any chance of addressing the housing crisis, this needs to change.""
A spokesperson for Skills and Training Minister Brendan O'Connor said Jobs and Skills Australia was an independent agency and was still in the consultation process to determine which occupations would be on the final ""core skills occupations list"".
""Jobs and Skills Australia will provide advice to the government on the core skills occupations list later this year,"" the spokesperson said.
Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil and Immigration Minister Andrew Giles retain decision-making power on the final list of trades eligible for the new visa, which will allow migrants to fill areas of skills shortage, as long as they have guaranteed annual earnings of at least $70,000, indexed annually. Successful applicants could have their visas approved in 21 days, and have their length of stay doubled to four years, with potential for permanent residency.
Coalition skills and training spokeswoman Sussan Ley accused the government of contributing to the construction shortfall.
""\[Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's\] failed energy and industrial relations policies were already making it harder than ever for the construction industry to build the homes Australians need, and now we see him making it even worse,"" she said.
""There is a clear contrast between the Coalition, who as \[Opposition Leader\] Peter Dutton said in the budget reply, will place tradies who can build homes at the front of the queue, versus Anthony Albanese who is busy kicking them out of the queue.""
Earlier this month, the National Housing Supply and Affordability Council's State of the Housing System 2024 report found the government's target of building 1.2 million homes by 2029 would fall short by more than 250,000 due to building industry constraints, complex planning processes and lack of land.
In December, O'Neil said migrant tradies would be considered under the core skills program, but ""we need to make sure it is not a free-for-all with unintended consequences for Aussies doing apprenticeships"".
However, the federal government is also under pressure to cut immigration, with the May budget forecasting a fall in net overseas migration to 395,000 this financial year and 260,000 next year and 255,000 in the subsequent year.",0,en-AU,Reddit,Sentiment

"Gas runs out. It produces ongoing waste. It's sourced from a small number of places, with a small number of providers. The price can rise incredibly sharply when policies (national, state, or corporate) change. Supply can be cut off.
Renewables don't run out - that's their whole point. They don't, in general, produce ongoing waste of multiple types from their point of production to their point of use, or at least it's significantly less than fossil fuels or nuclear. The production equipment is either highly recyclable or likely to be able to become so as technology advances. And because renewable power can be produced by thousands of companies, and even in-house by businesses and individuals, it's a lot harder for prices to do anything but go down per watt-hour, even on initial equipment costs. It's not controlled by a small number of providers. It doesn't need large-scale and separate infrastructure (of a kind significantly different to the existing electrical grid) to be maintained. It doesn't need things continually physically transported in order to operate. And it's a lot harder to cut off supply when more end-consumers are producing at least some of their needs themselves and can source the rest extremely locally.
The only two reasons to go with non-renewables are (1) price per watt-hour, and (2) politics from people who want to make all the money and/or have control over fuel supplies. And the first reason is rapidly approaching a non-issue, especially if you factor in total cleanup and waste-management costs from every aspect of the operational process.
Previously, the first reason held economic sway, and it made sense to go with non-renewables. I'm not about to point fingers at people who made that decision at the time. But it's becoming far less of one, and increasingly likely to swing over to renewables on larger scales than it already has, over time.",0,en-AU,Reddit,Sentiment

"It takes 1.6 units of electrical energy to produce 1 unit of hydrogen energy. That's simple chemistry and it can't be changed anymore than you can change the fact that if you set fire to wood you will get hear and light. But then you have to spend more energy refrigerating the hydrogen, and it's so cold it embrittles the pipes etc which have to be frequently replaced, it leaks and so on.
In the Space Shuttle programme, only 55% of the liquid hydrogen was actually burned in the rocket engines - the rest was lost in transit, evapourated in storage and so on. 12.6% was lost simply transferring it from a tanker truck to a storage tank.
So then you are in effect spending 1.6 x 1/0.55 = 2.91 units of energy to get 1 unit of useful hydrogen. Of course, we might suppose that we are going to be more efficient and effective than an agency which has half a century of experience handling liquid hydrogen and has spent billions of dollars trying to make it more efficient and effective, but this seems unlikely.

"Paywall
 The Clean Energy Council describes itself as the peak body for the clean energy sector. It is not. It is a powerful, cashed-up lobby group promoting the interests of wind, water and hydro generators with a mission to kill nuclear energy stone dead in Australia.
Last month, the council launched a multimillion advertising campaign on animated digital billboards, airport lounges and lifts in prime Sydney and Melbourne locations with the message that the discussion about nuclear power was risking Australia's future. It is merely a foretaste of a much larger campaign as the Coalition prepares to seek a mandate for removing the nuclear moratorium at the next federal election.
Opposition climate change and energy spokesman Ted O'Brien has been at pains to frame any discussion about nuclear around its place in the energy mix. Intermittent, disbursed generation technology such as wind and solar would continue to contribute to the grid. Gas also would be a crucial part of the mix, principally because of its agility to ramp up or down, compensating for the vagaries of renewable energy sources.
Yet the renewables sector has bought none of it. It regards the election of a Coalition government as an existential threat that would devalue its portfolios overnight. Implicit and explicit subsidies would be phased out. It would hasten the realisation that there was a threshold beyond which the saturation of renewables in the grid became more of a nuisance than a help and that we might already be in that territory.
""It is becoming increasingly clear that the nuclear push is designed to bring the rollout of renewables to a halt  not just temporarily, but for good,"" wrote Giles Parkinson, the editor of Renew Economy, the sector's equivalent of the China Daily.
Giles says there are fears the nuclear push will create more uncertainty for a sector already battling with bottlenecks and roadblocks in planning decisions, network capacity, connection delays, social licence and market regulations that are struggling to keep up with the transition.
At the end of the week, the announcement that the NSW government would pay Origin up to $225m to keep the Eraring Power Station operating for two years beyond its planned 2025 retirement confirmed that renewable energy had failed to deliver on its promise to provide the capacity required to survive without coal. The Victorian government has been negotiating similar extensions with EnergyAustralia, the owner of Yallourn, and AGL, which operates Loy Yong A. Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen belatedly has recognised the need for more gas in the system. The theory that the grid can operate on renewables alone in the medium term is now unambiguously discredited.
The Australian Energy Market Operator presented a dismal picture of the pace of the transition in its forecast for energy supply in the next 10 years, named somewhat optimistically as the Statement of Opportunities. AEMO said it had been advised of ""numerous delays to the development and commissioning of committed and anticipated wind and solar projects"", meaning the amount of energy in the system would be lower than predicted between 2025 and 2028.
This would increase the likelihood of unserved energy events, or blackouts as most people would call them. It gets worse. The new turbines and solar panels are rolling out at a fraction of the rate Bowen anticipated 18 months ago, and they need to get connected to the grid. Building 10,000km of new transmission lines has not been quite the walk in the park the minister seemed to have expected. Planning and construction delays and community resistance are putting transmission projects way behind schedule and over budget.
There is no good news for Bowen or the sector in the AEMO report. Project EnergyConnect, the interconnection between NSW and South Australia, was regarded as the most straightforward high-voltage transmission link since it passed through sparsely populated territory. Yet construction delays mean it will not operate at full capacity until July 2027 at the earliest. That will be too late to compensate for expected shortfalls once the Torrens Island B and Osborne power stations shut. In NSW, delays to battery projects mean supply will be even tighter than expected, and Victoria will feel the pinch from constraints on interstate transmission.
Even if we accept AEMO's optimistic claim that there are plenty of projects in the pipeline, this is hardly the fast-track transition the government promised. In October 2022, Bowen told a gathering of business leaders that meeting the government's 82 per cent clean electricity target by 2030 would require the installation of 22,000 solar panels a day, 62 million in total, by the end of the decade. It would require a 7-megawatt wind turbine to be commissioned every 18 hours, each as high as Crown's One Barangaroo tower in Sydney. About 10,000km of new high-voltage transmission lines would be needed to link up the vastly expanded network.",0,en-AU,Reddit,Sentiment

"The debt-burdened Allan government is spruiking its wholly public births, deaths and marriages agency to private investors in a bid to bolster its beleaguered finances.
Treasurer Tim Pallas has begun discussions with private equity firms to gauge their interest in running some of the registry's services.
Pallas met with one firm last week, according to a private industry source familiar with the negotiations, and pitched the idea as a ""limited-term contract"" in the style of the partial privatisation of VicRoads' licensing and registration arms  a deal due to expire in the 2060s.
The industry source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardise commercial interests, said the treasurer was ""hoping to close any deal by the end of the year"".
A fresh offer from a private consortium could raise billions of dollars in the short term for Victoria's bottom line while providing superannuation companies or others with tens of millions of dollars in guaranteed annual income from birth, death and marriage certificates.
A cabinet minister, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed there was a desire for several years at the highest levels of government to rebuild Births, Deaths and Marriages through the private market.
""It can probably be done better,"" the minister said.
The senior MP went on to say the registry would ideally be brought back into the government fold entirely once it had proven its value to the taxpayer.
Births, Deaths and Marriages has dealt with high-profile issues in recent years, particularly during the pandemic, when its offices were closed, it took months for officials to issue certificates and urgent emails went unanswered.
Asked if the agency was to be privatised, a government spokesperson instead described the preferred model as a joint venture partnership.
""Victoria's Births, Deaths and Marriages service will not be privatised, but we are looking at how we can continue to improve the quality of government services.""
The government to this day insists the partial privatisation of some VicRoads services was not privatisation, but a joint venture partnership.
Just seven months ago, the government was predicting it would be in deficit by about $1 billion by June 2025. That expected financial hole more than doubled to $2.2 billion in the May 7 state budget.
The same budget papers forecast Victoria's debt to rise to $187.8 billion by June 2028. In simple terms, the May budget leaves Victorian taxpayers with a $25 million daily interest bill.
Labor's primary vote has also plummeted below 30 per cent since Jacinta Allan became premier, according to an exclusive survey published by this masthead last month. The survey found two-thirds of voters wanted the government to do more to reduce debt.
But additional partial privatisation in the name of budget repair would not come without risks. The Coalition will use any proposed agreement with industry to slam the government's management of debt and government agencies. Meanwhile, the Greens would argue such a move undermines the public service.
Labor will also be in power in Victoria for a decade come December, the timeframe Pallas has told industry he wants the agency deal signed.
Researcher Charlie Joyce, from the independent but progressive think tank the Australia Institute, said he suspected further privatisation was politically dangerous in Victoria.
""Daniel Andrews campaigned in 2022 against privatisation,"" Joyce said. ""He promised to bring back the State Electricity Commission. A further re-embrace of privatisation would lead to a loss in trust in the Allan government which, I think, frankly, is already fraying.""
Joyce said while Victoria's debt levels were an important consideration, his research on privatisation showed even partial privatisation was often ""short-term gain for long-term pain"".
""For something like Births, Deaths and Marriages, this is a government service that handles very sensitive information. A private owner that cuts costs on security  cybersecurity in particular  could quite quickly run into trouble.
""It would [also] be a colossal mistake to take a step that may reduce the quality of public services and increase the cost.""
Birth, death, marriage or change of name certificates start from $54.40 in Victoria, but registrations and commemorative certificates are more expensive. There were 72,932 registered births in Victoria last year, 29,826 marriages and 45,345 deaths.
The total administered income from identity and worker screening transactions in Victoria for the six months to June 30 last year was $33.83 million, according to the Department of Government Services' most recent publicly available annual report.
The same report states that Births, Deaths and Marriages failed to meet its timeliness target in the 2022-23 financial year.
It took the agency, on average, 10.9 days to process compliant applications for birth, death and marriage certificates in the 12 months to June last year. Its target for the period was less than 10 days.
The price of general-issue licence plates, black motorbike plates and slimline black custom licence plates all increased by $15 on January.
Driver licensing and registration aren't the only services partly privatised since Victorian Labor came to power in December 2014.
The Port of Melbourne was leased to a private consortium for 50 years under a $9.7 billion deal in 2016 and the Victorian Land Titles Office was partly privatised in 2018 for more than $2 billion.
Last year's housing statement also revealed Melbourne's public high-rise towers will be handed over to private developers in the coming years as part of a mixed model.
When VicRoads was partly privatised in 2022, Pallas refused to label the development privatisation.
""This is not privatisation in anybody's language,"" the treasurer said at the time.
""We're always looking to see how we can drive better services, better performance, but we will never divest the ownership of assets.""
The partial privatisation of VicRoads was also pitched as injecting $7.9 billion into Victoria's coffers.
Under the VicRoads deal, the state maintains ownership of the service, the Victorian Ombudsman preserves its oversight and there were extensive talks with the Australian Services Union to ensure workers kept their jobs.
However, a consortium comprising Aware Super, Australian Retirement Trust and Macquarie Asset Management was allowed to run the agency's licensing and registration for the next 40 years.",0,en-AU,Reddit,Sentiment

"Bit off topic, but it will be really interesting to see the proposed boundaries for NSW;  the eastern half of metro Sydney is set to lose one or maybe two seats, and I'm curious as to which side of the harbour this will take place. 
I don't think it's feasible for a cross-harbour seat to be created, so I think North Sydney (especially as it's one of the federation seats) and Sydney aren't going anywhere.
I think if one of the northern seats will disappear, the one which makes most geographical sense will be Warringah. Mackellar can't move north of the Hawkesbury as it will be non-contiguous, so I think it will become a thinner, beach-oriented seat. Bradfield, Bennelong, and North Sydney could be pushed east; the latter could feasibly cross Middle Harbour in a similar manner as the state seat of Manly.
Then again, the AEC wants to retain Aboriginal place names when possible, which complicates things yet again. 
As a side note, I dislike the practice of non-geographical names for electoral divisions (even though in this case, Warringah is a geographical name). I'm no advocate for the American numerical system, and I do recognise that geographical names can sometimes be leads to fewer absurdities; Lake George, for instance, existed within the seat of Werriwa for only a decade, and Warringah possibly moving north to replace Mackellar while no longer covering Middle Harbour just creates another pointless quirk.
If it's on the south side of the harbour, then I think it will be messier. Wentworth is another 1901 seat, so I could see its boundaries moving south. Alternatively, Sydney could theoretically be split between Wentworth and Grayndler (it is oddly enough the newest of the three), but I don't think that would please anyone. I can't imagine the AEC removing Albanese's seat either. Possibly Barton could be partitioned?
Also interested to see what will happen in the Hunter. Labor seems intent on shoring up Hunter at the expense of Paterson (demographics trending away from the party in both) by drawing in Maitland and cutting out the Upper Hunter, but the geographical constraints of Port Stephens and Lake Macquarie could well lead to an arragement that would make an Illinois mapmaker blush.",0,en-AU,Reddit,Sentiment

"There's still lots of money out there being spent and it's pushing up inflation. I work in sales, we distribute composite decking, cladding and screening through trade hardware stores. 
Generally speaking cladding goes on new builds while decking is mostly for the renovations/add on market. Usually the colder months are slow, with cladding holding sales together, while summers the decking really takes off (people are short sighted, they only want to put in decks when it gets warm and realise they don't have one, or their existing one is falling apart). 
We had a bit of a slow start this year, but this month we are getting'summer' level of sales, both in decking and cladding, which is something that none of us really expected. Cladding would make sense because builds happen year round, but people are spending big on renovations as well, which isn't what you'd expect during a cost of living crisis. 
As much as I'd love to say this is because I'm an amazing sales rep, every other state is pushing similar numbers, with sales at 120% of budget coming into the end of financial year. I've got friends that work for our competitors and they are also seeing the same results. There may be a cost of living crisis somewhere, but it sure as shit isn't everywhere, and we expect even more money pumped into the economy come early August as that's bonus/commission season for anyone in sales and corporate, as well as tax return season.",1,en-AU,Reddit,Sentiment

"I just went through this with my tenant who wants to break the lease on 10 days notice.
The tenant was good and I was hoping he would stay long term. I wasn't going to increase the rent on his 1st renewal.
Anyway he's leaving a few months before his 12 month contract.
I had to option to charge him the leasing and advertising fee. I choose not to charge this but I will hold him to paying the rent until I find someone else.
I won't be picky about the new tenant as long as they have a job and reasonable rental history just like I would for any tenant. Single mothers no problems.
Even in a rental crisis It does take time to find a tenant. Just most people who want to rent a place will want to move in after 2 to 4 weeks (gives them time to exit their current living arrangement).
I've always found the winter months are harder to find a tenant as most people start their lease at the end of or start of the year.

The crispy coating and tender meat made it a delightful treat. However, I must admit that the ambience left a bit to be desired. It was adequate, but I would rate it 3 out of 5. Perhaps they could improve the decor or lighting to enhance the dining atmosphere. One aspect that disappointed me was the absence of some advertised offers, which they had posted on social media. I was looking forward to trying those deals, but unfortunately, they were not available during my visit. On the positive side, the service was prompt, and the staff was courteous and attentive. They made sure we had everything we needed throughout our meal. Another commendable aspect was the cleanliness of the restaurant. The tables and chairs were well-maintained, and the washrooms were spotless. In conclusion, Al Baik offers a delectable fried chicken experience that can easily compete with KFC. Although the ambience could use some improvement, the friendly service and clean environment compensate for it.

The price point is very lucrative 5 pc is their mini and 8 pc is their large. Veg momo starts with 50 and 70 for mini and large. 2. The stuffing of chicken is absolutely full i mean there is nothing than the chicken And do n't get fooled by the size the momo is absolutely compact filled momo. Just one thing i do nt like them there is no proper seating arrangement and so crowded even sometimes insects also drops to your food first day we experienced that so today we took away.

No first aid facility and basic medical medicine are missing. Basic amenities are missing atleast Hotel provide basic amenities as per double occupancy if they book for two.

After check out they provide only proforma bill not original invoice. Basic details provide by you mentioned on bill is wrong as email i d.

The darkness of the theatre and the lack of distractions help to draw you into the world of the film, allowing you to fully immerse yourself in the story. Watching a movie in a theatre also has a communal aspect, as you share the experience with other audience members.

"A Flavorful Culinary Experience with a Few Salty Surprises. I recently dined at Spice Garden Restaurant and indulged in a delightful spread of dishes that left my taste buds buzzing. The ambience and outdoor deck seating provided a charming backdrop for the afternoon, making it a pleasant dining experience. For starters, the chilli momos and chilli prawns were an absolute hit. The perfect blend of spices and the right amount of heat made these dishes stand out. The steamed momos and seekh kebab kathi roll were also well-prepared, showcasing the chef expertise in crafting appetizing bites. Moving on to the main course, the Spice Garden Non-Veg Platter was a generous assortment of flavors. However, I must mention that the Chicken Changezi and Malai Soya Chaap were a bit on the salty side, which somewhat affected the overall enjoyment of these dishes. It would be great if the kitchen could adjust the salt levels to enhance the dining experience. The Bread Basket and hot gulab jamun with vanilla ice cream were delightful additions to the meal, offering a variety of textures and tastes. Despite the minor setback with the saltiness in some dishes, the overall food quality was commendable. The service was too slow and un-attentive causing a negative aspect to the dining experience may be because they were new or untrained. Once the person took the order of starters he vanished had to run back to the reception to fetch bottles of water and order something for the next course. The restaurant ambiance and outdoor seating make it an ideal spot for a relaxed evening with friends or family. In conclusion, Spice Garden Restaurant delivers a satisfying culinary journey with a diverse menu and a charming atmosphere. I recommend trying their starters, especially the chilli momos and prawns, while hoping for a slight adjustment in the salt levels, a trained and hospitable staff for a perfect dining experience.",1,en-IN,Google,Sentiment

Kadhambam side dish-amazing. Prepared as a mixture frim most parts of goat-liver, kidney, manga. The curry was also too good. It was very fresh. MUST TRY DISH. Pichi potta kooli fry-if your a lover of spicy food go for it. It was prepared with good amount of pepper. Eat this dish you we get your mouth hot. It tasted to next level with rasam & curd rice. Mutton Biriyani-Heavenly food. No other words. Non-veg meals-it was not to our expectations when compared to Chennai meals. It had two varieties of non-veg curry but for us it was like veg curry no flavour of non-veg. It comes with a boiled egg & unlimited meals. But they claim this is there speciality meal. If you plan for meal, my suggestion is go for veg meals & order non veg side dish. One more think, the salt was less in most of the dishes so add it for your taste to enjoy it. The hotel is just on the bye-pass before you reach Salem & before the Salem famous Selvi mess. It has ample parking area with a friendly elderly person to assist you in parking.

We initially tried to order Hyderabadi Biryani, only to be told it was n't available, which was puzzling for a dinner item during dinner hours. We settled for the Chilli Paneer-Fried Rice combo and cold coffee, which set us back 357 rupees, an amount that seemed excessive given the meager portions we received.

"This was once a best theatre around this region, But right now it is not upto the mark. It badly needs renovation. I have been visiting this theatre since childhood and it was good until 5 years back. After then there were lots of things that felt like should be improved. The sound quality is really poor and inside the theatre and there are literally spiderwebs on the walls. There is another theatre in town run by the same management called Sathiyan Cinemas, where the sound quality is much better than Pandian. This theatre really has scope to get improved, but has not made any improvements recently. The snacks inside this theatre is not that much great. You get only the old school kind of snacks like wheel chips, popcorn and egg puffs. When you but tickets online, you still have to wait in the counter before the movie to get the physical copy of the ticket to get inside the cinema hall. This is literally so outdated management technique. If you have booked online then why should you go to the counter again when you have a soft copy of the tickets. Also for buying snacks there is no UPI payment option. So regarding the digital aspects this theatre is still in 2010. The cleanliness of restrooms is not upto the mark. This theatre badly needs to consider all this options and make changes regarding it. Considering the improvements of Cinema experience in many other towns like Karaikudi this theatre has the scope to make the experience much better, but feels like they refuse to do so. Other than that this theatre has a bigger screen and the picture quality is good, but if you are watching other language movies then you might not get to see the subtitles since they zoom in and crop the picture which makes the subtitles go out of the screen( Recently watched Manjummel Boys and had this experience). The Air conditioning system is really good in this theatre. If someone from the theatre management sees this review, kindly take them into consideration and please make improvements. Thanks!",0,en-IN,Google,Sentiment

"Nestled in the heart of Ranchi, Bharat bakery is a charming haven for pastry enthusiasts and those with a penchant for delightful confections. My recent visit to this quaint bakery left me with an overwhelmingly positive impression, and I am eager to share my experience. The moment I stepped through the door, the aroma of freshly baked treats enveloped me, creating an immediate sense of warmth and comfort. The display cases, adorned with an array of meticulously crafted pastries, cakes, and bread, showcased the bakery commitment to both artistry and quality. The variety of options available was impressive, catering to a diverse range of tastes. From classic croissants to innovative cupcakes, each item seemed like a work of edible art. What stood out was the evident attention to detail  the perfect layers of a mille-feuille, the glossy finish on the fruit tarts, and the precision in every icing swirl. I opted for a selection of pastries and was delighted by the explosion of flavors with each bite. The freshness of the ingredients was unmistakable, and it was evident that the bakers at Bharat bakery take pride in sourcing high-quality components for their creations. In conclusion, Bharat bakery is a gem in the heart of Ranchi, offering not just baked goods but a genuine experience for the senses. Whether you're stopping by for a quick indulgence or seeking the perfect dessert for a special occasion, this bakery delivers on both taste and presentation. I left with a box of treats and a smile, eager to return and explore more of the delectable offerings.

Although my recent experience might not have been perfect, I'd still rate it a solid 4 for several reasons. First, let me address today experience. We ordered Dragon Chicken, and it was a bit tougher than usual, not meeting our expectations. The Chilli Garlic Fried Rice was decent, but the Oriental Chicken dish was unexpectedly spicy, making it a bit challenging to enjoy. However, the reason for my 4-star rating lies in the consistent quality of food I've enjoyed in the past at Second Wife. The Kebabs, in particular, have always been a highlight, with their delicious flavors and perfect texture. This restaurant has been a reliable choice for tasty food, and I hope that today experience was just a one-time hiccup.

Another drawback I think is their washing area; a small basin is there with a separate jug kept which one needs to pour and wash the hands if required; but that may be due to the lack of space.

Then I asked how about the pastry which he gave me taste he says we'll patch it and give to other customer... That sounded sooo disgusting.....

"Nothing to say about brand mio amore. Because we all know the quality of food products. All are quality products. I can review the branches of the shop. As at Burdwan town itself has 3 or 4 branches. This branch, means par Birhata is nearer to my home. Here all varieties are not available in options of cakes and pastries. If it is occasion periods going on, then you always get fresh products, but in normal time sometimes you may experience cakes of previous storage stocks, I mean not fresh. I have self experience. As I say, varieties as well as stocks are limited, in occasion seasons products become empty within few hours and you can not get yours. So, I personally prefer the branch at Barobazar, Burdwan, near CMS School. There are no issues for complaining. Other than mio amore own products, do n't buy other accessories for birthday or anniversary. Because it claims higher price than local market and does not give any computerised bill for other accessories in Parbirhata know about the other branches. When say about brand mio amore, I love blue berry pastry, choco muffins, red velvet cake, black forest cake the most. I do n't like choco chips pastry as it is full of cream. Actually I do n't like all the items here in which Maine part is mostly different types of cream. The snacks items available here are so so. Can not say the best.

It was then left to Jiten Basu granddaughter Bidisha to take charge, and her battle for survival continued amidst the strong challenges posed by the multiplexes and mushrooming OTT platforms. While Prachi initially screened only Bengali films, it has evolved with the times to now accommodate Hindi and English cinema too.

Maybe they should remove the cheap from the name. They have an AC dining area in the 1st floor but the AC stays off in the "" winter ""( like every other shop with AC in town) and the windows also stay closed.

"Went at on Sunday and was not expecting it to be crowded in fact we got the last table available that was for 6, we were only 4( including a 5 year old). Did not expect it to be so crowded at 8 actually so after 8 you can expect waiting. Ambience is good no doubt. 1 The Turkish lamb soup was nice. 2 The hummus with chicken was also nice, tandoori roti was a little dry though but I ca n't complain. 3 Chicken Cheese Fatayer is good. 4 Chicken Ankara Tandoori was nice but had better tandoori than this. 5 Chicken Mandi rice was okay. Plus 1 Bisleri and Sprite for the above entire menu we paid which I think was little on the higher side. Did not expect this much, anyways actually the amount is high because the quantity is limited. The staff was very courteous and polite they were not properly trained but there attitude towards there guest was commendable. One table besides us ordered fish and than the couple complained that it was bland and no taste, the staff said in Turkish cuisine this is the taste but the couple did not agree. Although I feel the hotel was right they gave them a completely new chicken dish and took the fish back. So there attitude is right, the management must he having this attitude hence the employees carry it, trickle down effect. Overall Food is good Quantity is less Ambience is nice Price is high But The attitude is just right.

"I am editing the review after an year, in these have went to the restaurant for 15 to 20 times and ordered through swiggy. Recently, am facing worst experiences from the restaurant and some the things that I observed are: 1. Chicken biryani is not that par in taste and quality wise compared to the price. 2. Chicken lollipops are worst. I got leftover food delivered to me which I ordered through swiggy, chicken was hard to chew and dry. Also, have tasted nalli gosh biryani which is awesome in taste. I can see that the quality is decreasing over the time. We have ordered: mutton hot & sour soup( Rs 145), tandoori half plate( Rs 250), mutton dum biryani( Rs 350). 1. Mutton soup was a bit spicy. Really well. 2. Tandoori was awesome, best tandoori in. Chirala. No resturant in chirala provide Mayo( dawat, kanaka Durga) but they provide. Green chutney was superb. 3. Mutton dum biryani, mouth watering, biryani is soo good and mutton was perfectly cooked and juicy. Must try items: tandoori and mutton dum biryani.

"Brijwasi Kachori as the name suggest is a Kachori Samosa shop in Gwalior. Heard of famous Indori Samosa so ordered samosa here and when we got our samosa, I was totally surprised to see their presentation. The hot samosa was served inside the curry chatni, the taste of the chatni was awful. Literally you have to eat that hot samosa dipped fully in the liquid curry( see photo) with your bare hands. Very very tough to eat. Somehow we burn our hands and eat that samosa to have the taste, which is again verg ordinary and awful. I advise if you want samsosa or kachori here than ask them to give it without any curry. Located near to the Gwalior Railway station opposite to the DB Mall. Imarti was nice but cost wise pretty expensive. One imarti. Samosa / kachori",0,en-IN,Google,Sentiment
"Dominos are everywhere! I love the taste of their chicken wings. They are pretty delicious. Do not forget to try those if you happen to visit this place. Despite its noisy location, the food here is delicious. However, my experience here is not up to the mark. Firstly, it's crazy to witness the other female staff arguing with the male staff( who seems to be the head of the same group of workers). Keeping their argument aside, I am overwhelmed to see how the male staff handled the situation, with complete patience( although he struck the table out loud once). It's normal to argue with a coworker, right ?! We all do once in a while but choose the location wisely. To be honest, I'm completely unsure of what was going on since I do not speak Assamese. Secondly, y' all know that the temperature in this region is hot. I was expecting the AC to be turned on while customers are served but that did n't happen here( could be a technical problem but I did n't insist). I hope they value their customer more. To wrap this up, I'm happy with the delicious chicken wings and expect more value for a customer especially when they dine in despite many circumstances that could be avoided.",1,en-IN,Google,Sentiment

Nestled near Pipal Chauraha, this establishment proudly holds the title of one of the oldest and most cherished chat shops, offering a delightful fusion of flavors that captivate the palate. The star attractions here are undeniably the tikka and khasta, both showcasing an exceptional taste that leaves patrons craving more. The special touch in their tikka and the exquisite texture of the khasta are testament to the mastery honed over years of perfecting their craft. Additionally, their dosa adds another dimension to their menu, showcasing their versatility in offering diverse yet equally delightful options. While the food undoubtedly steals the spotlight, the ambiance might benefit from some refurbishment to enhance the overall dining experience. Yet, the lively atmosphere and the bustling energy contribute to the charm of enjoying street-style delights. For those seeking an authentic chat experience coupled with nostalgia and a rich culinary heritage, Kamta Chat Bhandar remains an essential destination.

"The valley of Kashmir has unique geographical features. Being home to the rarest of natural beauties, Kashmir hosts some of the most wondrous places in the world. When we think of Kashmir, the first thing we visualise is the beautiful Shikaras in Dal Lake, the exquisite Mughal Gardens, the cascading Shrunz and Aharbal waterfalls, the magical Betaab valley, the stunning Sonamarg and the glorious Gulmarg. True, Kashmir being one absolute Jannat or heaven on earth is brimming with natural splendour in every corner, but you still have more places in the valley which are unheard of and unexplored yet. One among them is Chattabal, surrounded with serene Himalayan ranges and meadows of pine and fir. Chattabal of Chitergul-Shangus area is just 32 km from district Anantnag and merely 20 km away from the famous Mughal Garden of Achabal, situated in the lap of Pir Panjal mountains. Chattabal is not really a name that many tourists know about. Not many people go in that direction, primarily because it is not high on the list of places to visit in Anantnag. The majority of the folks you will find up there will just be the locals from Anantnag or any of the nearby villages. The valley is replete with natural vegetation and flowers of wild nature. The vast green plains look like natural tapestries, as if spread by divine hands. It has two routes through which people can reach the place: one is from Shangus road, and the second is from KP Kehribal.",1,en-IN,Google,Sentiment

The beef roll is a bit small, the beef is chewy and the roll or paratha is tough. It tastes less than expected for 60 rupees. A bit oily, too much oil for my taste. It also lacks taste and you can taste the burnt paratha as well. Plain rice taste like plain rice, not too bad and not great. Chilli smells bad and just plain hot without any flavour Customer service is bad without much thought for the customer at all. They're extremely loud and the waiting time was long.

Do n't believe on other rumours like the food taste is bad and like that i also felt the same before visiting but here the service and atmosphere is good on the first floor they had a space that we can book for parties or huge family gatherings.

I will rate that one start is for the somewhat over priced but its not that bothering if we satisfy with the food.,1,en-IN,Google,Sentiment
"# Foodengineeringg A nice place to have good delicious BIRYANI and chicken starters... Have been here and i was amused with their food.. Starting with Grilled Chicken, this was super tender and juicy chicken. Cooked to perfection and loads of spices. Enjoyed it thoroughly... MALAI Chicken was good, tender and lil sweetness of Malai on it. And ca n't miss their Special Havemore Chicken Tikka, where you get 3 varients if chicken starters. Good one. Garlic Prawns was also nice.... Big size of prawns and lil touch of garlic. Phuket fish was nice too.. subtle taste and soft fish. # Maincourse Mutton Double Gosht Biryani was outstanding, Chicken 65 and one boiled egg on top and super tender mutton pieces stuffed inside fluffy and aromatic long rice grains and those are again decorated with Barista & twig of mint. Appetizing and flavourful biryani after long time... Chicken Punjabi was amaaaazing, hot in red gravy with big chunks of tender chicken. Gravy was flavourful enough and goes best with garlic Naan. # Desserts Qubani Ka Meetha, Double ka meetha and Phirni. My favourite was ofc phirni",1,en-IN,Google,Sentiment

"The Sir Mark Cubbon statue in Bangalore, set within the verdant expanse of Cubbon Park, is a historical monument dedicated to Sir Mark Cubbon, the British Commissioner of Mysore from 1834 to 1861. His tenure is often remembered for the administrative reforms and infrastructural development he brought to the region, significantly influencing the city layout and public administration system. The statue commemorates his contributions to Bangalore, serving as a bridge between the past and present. Erected in a location that is both central and scenic, the statue is surrounded by the natural beauty of Cubbon Park, making it a point of interest for visitors who come to enjoy the park tranquility and to learn about the city colonial history. Although opinions on colonial figures are complex and varied, the presence of the Sir Mark Cubbon statue provides an opportunity for reflection on the layers of Bangalore history, offering insights into the forces that shaped the city. This monument stands not just as a piece of art, but as a historical marker that prompts discussions about legacy, governance, and the impact of colonial rule in India.",1,en-IN,Google,Sentiment

Fondly called "" Avanthi, "" this vegetarian gem attracts crowds all day, drawn by its famous South Indian breakfasts and satisfying lunch meals. The recent renovation has breathed new life into the establishment. The makeover has not only enhanced its visual appeal but also improved the dining experience with a brighter, more inviting ambiance, thanks to the strategic placement of glass windows that usher in an abundance of natural light.

"Akbar had built several palaces in the Agra Fort, and his son and successor Jahangir had added to them. These comprise the Jahangiri Mahal and Akbari Mahal, both approached through a beautiful gate decorated with red sandstone and yellow dholpur stone. The palaces inside are small, made almost completely of red sandstone, very intricately carved, and with some traces of beautiful painted and incised plaster. The Agra Fort ticket, Rs 35 per Indian adult, covers these palaces. An interesting artefact just outside the gate here is Jahangir bath tub, shaped like a giant tea cup with rough steps on the side to climb in.",1,en-IN,Google,Sentiment

We had to wait for some empty seats, self service it was, making the order took some time, then waiting at the counter for the food also took sometime. The food was ok there, I thought the hype was a little more for that place. Porotta were good, kerala porotta( how can it be bad).

"The moment the word'Dalit' comes up in a sexual assault case, most of us who dominate the discourse on social media (urban upper caste) don't know how to feel.

In some corner of our minds, there's a notion that because such kind of violence towards Dalits is common, it's not that big of a deal. It doesn't threaten our own safety because ""they"" are different from us. We know that the power dynamics at play in a Dalit assault don't apply to us. We rationalize it and then we forget about it.
If it happens to one of us, there's shock and disbelief and fear and outrage. It catches our attention and instantly makes us justice warriors.

"Brijesh Kumar Mishra, the main accused in a high-profile immigration scam involving fake offer letters from Canadian colleges, has pled guilty to three counts and has been sentenced to three years in prison.
Mishra, who was arrested by the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) on June 23, 2023, now faces approximately 19 months of imprisonment after accounting for time served, though he may be eligible for parole before completing the full term.
Mishra, who operated a firm called M/S Education Migration Services, was charged with multiple offenses under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. These included unauthorized representation, counselling misrepresentation, and aiding individuals to misrepresent or withhold material facts. The scam, which came to light in March 2023, affected hundreds of Indian students, primarily from Punjab, who were facing deportation from Canada after discovering that their offer letters were fake.
According to the CBSA, Mishra, who hails from Darbhanga in Bihar, was apprehended at an airport in British Columbia while attempting to enter Canada later years The charges laid against him stemmed from a comprehensive criminal investigation that revealed he had been offering immigration advice without a proper license and had been inducing clients to misrepresent information to Canadian authorities.
The court proceedings detailed Mishra's actions between January 1, 2016, and February 12, 2020, during which he knowingly advised individuals in connection with immigration applications under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. His illegal activities were contrary to Section 91(1) of the Act and resulted in significant distress for many students and their families.
On March 17, 2023, Jalandhar police registered a case against Brijesh Kumar Mishra and his partners under sections 465, 467, 468, 471, and 120B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The investigation was later transferred to the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit. Additionally, the Jalandhar district authorities revoked the license of his consultancy.
Mishra charged an average of Rs 16 lakh from each student for visa-related services and college admissions. Upon the students' arrival in Canada, Mishra would inform them that seats were unavailable at the colleges listed in the offer letters. He would then advise them to either seek admission at other colleges or wait for the next intake. In some instances, he returned the college fees, but in many cases, he did not.",0,en-IN,Reddit,Sentiment

By leaving the house or fighting back, you will not solve anything. You are perhaps too young to understand a few things, and that is okay and not being said to be disrespectful. Everyone goes through all life phases, but here I am trying to give you some wisdom, and hopefully, you can use it to your advantage.
I was in a very similar situation growing up in a middle-class family. One day, all of a sudden, my angry father, whom I loved and respected a lot but never said, got diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumor. Fast forward to a few months, he took his last breath in my arm, and neither of us said to each other how much we loved and cared for each other. 
We take things and people for granted and only realize their value when they are no longer around. 
The only way to solve your situation is for one party to compromise, and I know you would think they should learn the new ways because they are the elders, and you are the young ones. They should love you first. But that is not how it will work. You will need to talk to them with love and respect. Continue doing that, and one day, they will realize. Even if they don't, you will have no regrets later in your life.
The only answer is unconditional love and respect.

Infact Chinese jets are half stolen US reverse engineered tech and the rest is russian. 
2. Rafale's are in a league of their own, a few years ago french forces, claimed to have won a dogfight with f-22 raptor in a friendly exercise.
3. Russian jet engines are not as good as western counterparts. Although they are faster, they are a lot bulkier, bigger and have substantially more downtimes/ maintainance times than western jets and their engines.
4. Russian engines on an average last only 4000hrs while American ones last about 10-12k hours. (Not sure about rafale)
5. Rafal's are just a lot more reliable have better avionics etc. it makes sense

Every religion is flawed and barbaric and people defend it. Christianity is based on human sacrifice. And hinduism has gems like the caste system and sati. 
>any other scholars come out and speak against their agenda of converting the entire world to one religion
An ideology cannot grow if it does not try to grow. All religions either do this or go extinct. That's how a religion works. Christians have missionaries that do the exact same thing. Hinduism does the same except it assimilates any and everything into hinduism. You worship a fish, that's fine, you worship a cow, that's fine, you eat fish and cow, that's fine too. That's the modern hinduism. Animal sacrifice is an essential part of Bengali Hindu culture, which would be unimaginable to a rajasthani veg Hindu.

"My father was a government employee. He hated polling duties. Only very high ranking officials get good facilities. Although he was generally exempt from polling duties due to his job profile. 
One time, when he was a high ranking official, he was attached as zonal coordinator for Election Observer. He was provided an AC Cab, an armed Escort and contact info for all District election officers ( DM) in the region. He left home two days before the election with the Observer, travelling through remote polling booths making sure fair elections are being held. Calling police forces were needed, diffusing tense situations and returned home in the evening after the elections were done. 
He was accommodated in good hotels and guest houses, circuit houses, private guest houses of industries though he had hardly any time to eat or sleep. On the election eve, he got a call from a presiding officer of a booth about a broken machine. He went to the room of the DM of the district who was staying in the same guest house. DM opened the door, while talking on the phone on his shoulder while feeding the baby with a bottle. 
Some people will be like, so what if government employees have to work hard for a few days, most people work hard everyday. That's true, the only difference is that in case of election duty, every mistake is a fireable offense with jail time. And it's so easy to make mistakes when you have no idea what you are doing.  
You forgot to paint the finger for a voter? Jailed.

Merely because they're in the minority. To that end these fine upstanding most Indian of Indians will sink to any depths, make up any amount of bullshit to spread fear, lie, steal, and cheat their way into positions of power from which they can do their bidding and keep the masses distracted with this petty bullshit so they don't pay attention to the real issues holding the country back.

For example you can see construction cranes and material conveyor belt like things being used by bigger companies because that gives them cost optimisation and they're able to compete with other modernized players
Whereas if you go to smaller towns or to people who do smaller scale work, they still use old methods.
Why?
1 The new methods needs a lot of skills, time and patience to reach a level of competency required for giving the customer the same set of deliverables as they do now.
2 Financial incentive: It is often a large captial expense required to make the switch for smaller setups who may not have credit access. And since the demand for that kind of work doesn't reward extra for  it being done by any modern method , there's no incentive.
3 Risk taking ability. Every new migration comes with challenges. So for example if you want a small store owner to begin to track his inventory and make sales  using a cloud solution they won't be ready to face an outage or the prospect of paying more for security or similar upgrades because it doesn't add that much value compared to the cost

Government has no business in doing business. Highways are not like telephone plans or insurance. Don't think they can just be privatised the same way. Building highways is not a business for the government. It is an expenditure on infrastructure. 
They could turn it into a profitable business and start selling monthly subscriptions and family plans for people to drive on the highways instead of setting up toll booths only at district borders or such.

In today's circumstances, India regrettably does not have the privilege to take a moral stand in the Ukraine conflict, even though most of us are opposed to it personally. 1.4 billion Indian people need Russian oil badly, without which the country would come to a standstill. Also, it's important to recognise that this is not Russia's war, it's Putin's war, and our country needs to stand by its ally regardless of their leader.

"My father used to be a presiding officer and my elder brother is currently working as a presiding officer for today's vote. 
My father can't walk properly because his knees have filled with water and needs operation as soon as possible, but still he gets warning letters to this day and threats that his salary will be deducted inspite of several medical proofs. He had to walk 5-6 kms to get to the polling booth in some very remote village in the Bardhaman district, with no proper water supply,  almost no sanitation, sometimes not even proper food for the night or fans. He gave up doing this job 3 years ago.
The previous year, the booth where my elder brother was the presiding officer, got attacked by some local goons with guns and knives in their hands. They took the voting machines and went away, and locked my elder brother and 5 other booth workers in a dark room with no windows and fans, no food and water. My elder brother called the police, but the police said that they won't be able to lodge a complaint as the goons have made a settlement with them. After 5 hours like that, at around 5 in the evening, finally a group of military personnel came and escorted my brother and the other officers out of the booth and took them to their residence. The next day my elder brother boarded the first express train from the station and came back home.",0,en-IN,Reddit,Sentiment

"OP. Here is my take on this. As any other person on this subreddit, you can choose to ignore this and go off on a tangent.
The problem about Hindu vs Muslims, is not one about religions. It is not about cultural practices either. It is nevermore so about the wrongs done by one community on other. The problem is, however, about isolation.
Think about your parents. How many Muslims on average do they interact with in a normal and very casual setting, say every day? Or let's say every week? Every month? Every year? In last 10 years of their lives?
The answer you will find is very few. There is very little exposure today. While the world is connected more so than ever, the exposure has decreased. So where do they get their exposure to form opinions about others? From media. And I am not talking about News media. I am talking about the entire media in general. Be it songs, movies, shows, art, literature, etc. Anyone who is forming their opinions, either in positive light or in negative light, they are doing so by exposing the themselves to these media.
Now, why is media so polarising? Is it because of politics? Well, that has always been true to a partial extent. Then is it because of apathy? That is essentially an outcome, isn't it? So it can't be that.
The answer to above will be the need for comfort. Majority population in every nation, in every era, in every region, has always been on a struggle to survive. In times past, the working hours were less, but the living conditions weren't so much. In times of current era, the living conditions have improved exponentially, but so have working hours and need for labour. All this leaves a common populace devoid of energy to look outside of what they find comfortable, be it in terms of opinions and thought process or in terms of experiences. And this is why they turn to media.
We have seen examples, countless many, that illustrate that people who are exposed to a widers variety of opinions and cultures are able to empathise more easily with others and be a tad bit more understanding.
But this exposure requires you to ensure you get exposed to both wrongs and rights of an idea or a culture. Simply being content with one side of a community or ideal will always make you blind to the other side and hamper a full understanding of why someone may stand on the opposite end of the empathy spectrum with respect to the idea or culture you support or stand against.
And all of this is individual effort. It is no one else's responsibility to ensure you are exposed to every facet of an idea or culture. No moral responsibility or ethical responsibility, lies on others to improve your understanding. You yourself are the sole heir of that responsibility. Others may sometimes come as a guide or helpers to point you in a direction.
So both you and your parents have yet to fully understand the ideas and cultures you support and/or stand against.",1,en-IN,Reddit,Sentiment
"How is it exploitation if it creates work. I don't understand?
The delivery drivers are paid for the pickup too right? 
Also the customers the people you accuse of exploiting aren't they themselves exploited too then? Someone here rightly pointed out that the consumer is also time bound and taking time off to go return a product, marks a half day for him which directly cut from their pockets.
If it's about low standards, harsh timelines, and other factors associated to a job then the whole of Indian is exploited isn't it? I've worked a corporate white collar job in a reputed service based company and I've regularly crammed up 10am to 3am work schedule worked 7days a week with such tight deadlines that I've skipped dinner at time. So many people Ik are on anti depressants because their work gives them bad intrusive thoughts.
Also if you decide to make your own returns, you in a way would take out from their job as less people would be needed in the market so for the same job? It's like saying t*s  should either up their mass entry package from 3.5 lpa to 6lpa or shouldn't hire at all.

The cons: the kids' milkshake bottle was more than half with foam, the cooler drink was more ice than actual juices advertised-which after a few sips became almost tasteless, very small portion of fries for the price very little toppings, mac and cheese was no cheese sauce. All in all, we felt "" robbed "" of our food and drinks. The high bill did not reflect what was actually ordered...    And at last, it is not a kid friendly place, especially for kids with high energy levels, nothing is provided to keep them occupied. So, do not bring kids or bring your own entertainment.",0,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

"On the face, a tired 1920s hotel with splendid views of Brighton seafront. With an old revolving art deco entrance, it 1920 lift with push buttons and an old leather chair where Churchill one sat, this hotel breathes age but not in a good way. The rooms are large, clean, warm and comfortable but really outdated and tired decor and furnishings. Really surprised by the crack in the wall, the peeling paper from the ceiling. If you look beyond that though you receive the splendid charm the hotel has to offer. The bathroom was well equipped with a nice hotel-albeit temperamental shower-clean fresh towels. Rooms bit noisy due to building standards during the 20s( hear people walking about upstairs) and traffic noise but they provide quality earplugs! Breakfast was yummy with a full range of hot and cold options. Very well presented and high quality ingredients. The staff are very helpful and that really defines what the hotel is about-service. Upon arrival we did n't like our room so rather than usual hassle you have with hotels around availability, the manager of this hotel took the time to show us three rooms and we could choose the one we preferred. In terms of service I felt like a guest in a rather than a two hundred room hotel. You ca n't underrate that. This brings me to the ultimate question-what defines a good hotel experience ? For me it a comfortable bed( 5 stars here really comfortable bed), good attentive service with an eagerness to fix when things wrong( 5 stars here). Good food, bar and breakfast( 5 stars again). Clean room( 5 stars). Finally a hot powerful shower( 4 stars for my room). The room decor is only a small part of it really but really does need to be upgraded desperately in most rooms. If you looking for the wow factor, do n't stay here. If you looking a nice attentive hotel experience where you are looked after and get a good night sleep, this may be the place for you.

"Worst customer service I encountered in years. Red, raw and at best, pink in parts chicken, not at all stringy or cooked, literally dunked in the frier and removed and served in the time that I washed my hands. Lord is my witness, we ordered, washed my hands without using the toilet I should point out, returned and food was served. Granted we were close to closing time but this is no excuse. The incredibly rude waitress decided shutting me up by suggesting a refund as everyone say it is red and is just the colouring and marinade but no problem just take refund is all I met with. I politely declined the offer for a refund and asked for it to be cooked properly / remade which the lady nodded seemingly in acknowledgement to but said ' just you can have refund '. Eventually they remade the food, which unsurprisingly took 3-4x longer to make and was actually cooked through. I never been made to feel like someone is shutting me up as a customer and am really not one to complain. Issues with food are understandable, but to argue needlessly with paying customers is entirely different, and furthermore, to degrade them, and pretend you understand what they are telling you when they say it is a red and pink solid cube, not stringy white chicken, and is uncooked, followed by slamming the customer complaints email on a table when asked for details and also suggesting you do n't know your managers name when politely asked whom I can address my concerns to given the food was shocking.",0,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

Pizza was well made and tasted nice. I got the Margherita pizza and it was brought out in good time. The garlic bread was the same size as the pizzas and it was very good; had alot of flavour and was tasted great. Service was average. Nothing bad by any means. Nothing to set it apart from other places though. The atmosphere was quite calm and it certainly made the experience better as it allowed for the enjoyment of the food.

"Horrible attitude from the main lady, no sense of good customer service right off the bat! The food is barely edible, no flavour at best. I ordered Jerk Chicken a complete miss( why would I trust a Nigerian to make good Caribbean food ? Idk) Jollof rice, I should be able to trust her with that at least right ? WRONG! Burn of the pot taste! Mean ole auntie ca n't cook The plantains were just allright, still no flavour though. Only saving grace was the price which is fair for the portions. Hence 2 stars and not zero. Of course, price is not shown anywhere, they just make it up on the fly and add a few more pounds to the total that they swear is part of the original deal. The 2 consistently ask customers to take off their face masks to order as they claim they ca n't hear through it. Absolute negligence in times of rampant Omicron variant!! I respectfully refused and immediately this one unprofessional main lady throws her hands up at the ceiling, kiss her teeth at me and displays other terribly immature, rude attitude urging her employee to deal with me because of it. Mind you, i caught a cold and did n't want to risk coughing in their faces but i guess that's just me. Note to the crazy auntie, if you're going to be such a disrespectful drama queen at least back it up with some good cooking skills! Like I said to them, as a first time customer, I wo n't return even though I really did want to try their grilled fish next.",0,en-UK,Google,Sentiment
"Great location, which was very busy on a Saturday night so would definitely recommend booking ahead of time. The atmosphere inside was great, with stylish decorations and a great internal layout. Service was fast and professional, although we did get asked quite a few questions that were probably not necessary. The burger and Moroccan lamb tasted great, however the chocolate bombe was fairly underwhelming in taste and felt more like a gimmick than a nice desert. The wine offered was also on a serious mark up for average quality, although I guess that is typical of most places these days. Overall it was a nice experience and is a safe choice for anyone in the area looking for a tasty, yet fun dining experience!",1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

"I've always been a sainsburys shopper but the Loughborough branch needs some improvements. Just about all the trolleys have stiff wheels or make a racket. The lady on the self checkouts on Monday mornings puts a lot more importance on her conversation with friend colleague than customers, and you often have to wait at the self checkout for alcohol or whatever to be approved even when there are hardly any customers. This week I used self scan as usual and at the checkout it lost my entire shop. I tried to get the attention of the supervisor but she was chatting as usual so I wheeled my trolley to the kiosk but no one was there. I could have just walked out with my unpaid for shopping. I went back and interrupted the supervisor and told her what had happened. She was dismissive and said it had happened to someone else that morning and the only thing to do was to scan it all again. Bearing in mind it was all neatly packed into bags! Annoying enough but she was n't even remotely apologetic. Just went back to chatting. It's a good job for sainsburys that I have a conscience as I was so annoyed I felt like just nicking the whole lot. Shame because the produce is good, just some fairly serious customer service issues.",0,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

My portion of beans was just a handful of beans. But flavor wise it was delicious. Especially the bread! Their homemade scone was also fantastic.

There were no notices informing customers that there was a problem with the contactless payment machines. She said that the staff were informing customers verbally, which is not true.

"I love a burger and have now tried Five Guys twice. I was disappointed After my first visit, but awarded them 3 stars. I wanted to give them a second try, but found their offering to unfortunately be consistent and have dropped my rating to 2 stars. The quality of the ingredients is a bit better than standard fast food offerings, like McDonalds or Burger King. However, the cost is 3 to 4 times the price of McDonalds( consistent, but a bit bland) or Burger King( prone to inconsistency in delivery & service, and grubby restaurants, but tasty burgers). This would be tolerable, but the Five Guys burgers are immensely bland. They lack seasoning or any beefy flavour-they have no sear on the outside. The bacon is crispy, but this appears to be achieved by deep frying( it has a suitably uniform colour) which gives the bacon a scorched flavour. It is also unsmoked-a lost opportunity to make it tastier. The portions of fries are generous, but I would rather pay half the price for half the quantity( the generosity is probably a cynical technique to sell you more than you'd want to inflate prices). The fries are also a bit over-seasoned. The premium price gives the impression that this should be a faultless, high quality and above all delicious offering, yet it falls significantly short of this. It is n't bad, but better can be had for significantly less. For my first visit I spent for a burger, fries and a milkshake, which is frankly obscene!

The service was good, staff were polite, professional and attentive. The pancakes were popular as I could see several others order it. Overall, great! Would I go again ? Not really .",1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

"My family and I go to this Wetherspoon pub regularly, usually a couple times a week. Consistently the measure of the pints( so called) have been reduced week on week; today, every single one of our five pints were centimetres below a full measure. Having garnered the attention of a staff member, after chasing up a meal which was not sent out, I informed them of the situation. This was not met with understanding, nor apology for the consistent error: just "" ask for a top up when they bring it out "". I had accepted the laconic measure and only wanted the issue noted and passed on to the requisite bar staff, to avoid such poor practice in future. Henceforth, I will always correct the staff on first receipt of the pint; I will not consider it a momentary lapse due to human error.",0,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

When you go in you pay in advance and order your drinks which then get brought to whichever table you choose to sit on. A large selection of various starters, main courses and also a good selection of cakes, ice cream etc for afters. All the food was lovely apart from the shredded duck for the pancakes which two of the three of us found small bits of bone in. Service was spot on and it is obviously very popular as the flow of people arriving did not stop while we were there. Total bill for three, with pints of fizzy drinks was under 60-great value for money! Will definitely give it another try next time I am in the area.",1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

I( and my family) do unfortunately find it very hard to understand them as they really do n't speak clearly, which, they seem to use to their advantage. Ordered 3 meals, confirmed the 3 meals about 2-3 times( due to the difficulty in communication), and even then they tried to trick us numerous times. Price paid never matches their menu, they forget items until you remind them, and they try to say you've paid XX amount less than you need to to get you to pay again.

Was looking forward to trying something different from the norm and the chicken marinade selection at Wingstop sounded very tasty on the board. I ordered the box of 8 boneless chicken, fries with the Wingstop flavoring and a drink. What was served up however, was mediocre, the chicken was just warm and did n't contain much sauce on them. In the advert pics the chicken is drenched in sauce and flavouring-mine arrived with a dash of flavour. I do have to say the Brazilian and Mango Habanero sauces were good though. The fries with the Wingstop seasoning was OK, the seasoning contained clumps of sugar so I did n't enjoy it much. For near 14 I would n't have that again.

The burger I ordered had a burnt bun which was quite disappointing. All of these issues were brought up to a member of staff who shrugged it off, not really caring that our experience was unpleasant.

There was 5 courses over the course of about 2 hours. Overall the food was hit and miss, out of 4 different starters, we enjoyed two. But they had our orders wrong, one main was the wrong main, one came without gravy and by course 4 we were asked each time if we'd like food to go because they needed to clean. However, the staff Overall were lovely, and you could see they were doing as much as they could to help.

I have been coming here with my mum and sister and friends for close to forty years. Today there was a text for extra free tickets for you and 3 friends. There was a long queue and when I got close to the counter I realised I had left my phone in the car I told the member of the management team I had the text but had left my phone in the car she said that fine what package do you want ? but then would n't give me the extra tickets she said you ca n't expect to go to Tesco and get club card rewards without your card she was very sharp and rude. I get there are rules but I had brought a friend as well and this interaction does not promote loyalty to newcomers. A member of staff came to ask for help with a customer she snapped his head off and said I got a queue deal with it which really showed him up. I went back to my car and got my phone and got the extra tickets for me and my friend she was snapping at someone else at the counter.

I ordered food for our 4yr old, completely separately to the party, and it took 30mins to arrive, by which time she was crying with hunger.

Did n't eat there as we went next door to nandos so I ca n't comment on the food. The arcade section was pretty good as well. We and the kids had a few games of air hockey before leaving.

October update: Seafood risotto and seafood tagliatelle ordered. Both slightly underwhelming in flavour with far too much very rubbery and flavourless octopus in the seafood mixture. Had to pick it all out in the end as there was just too much of it( see photo). Even with lots of chilli oil( which was very mild indeed) and pepper, both dishes were rather disappointing. Jan 2024 A third visit delivered with fabulous pizzas though the server seemed very confused when I asked for no ham on the quattro pizza as it's supposed to be in 4 sections... Just add more of the other ingredients, I do n't mind which one, just not ham( hence my quattro became tre!). Would definitely recommend for their pizzas!",1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

"We enjoyed a lovely Sunday lunch in this buzzing, popular restaurant. This was the first time to Hearth after hearing good things and seeing the positive reviews. It was also a nostalgia trip, being an avid diner in Studio cafe back in the 90s when a student at the Art College in Hull in my youth. The restaurant has a simple, stylish interior and is a pleasant environment to dine. It also appears very well organised and had an abundance of service staff. We were seated in the upstairs restaurant seated opposite the open kitchen. The service was attentive from the staff for ordering and checking on drinks, but the main course food service was fairly slow. We decided on 2 courses and waited 45 minutes after ordering for our mains, which did seem too long. Desserts arrived much quicker, within 10 minutes The food quality is very good homestyle rustic comfort food( which seems to be the new bar set for Michelin guide rated food these days... as home cooked food becomes less the norm of society). Portions are generous, and Sunday lunch trimmings are plentiful. A special note for the meatloaf style sage and onion' pudding', which was deemed' the roast potatoes were perfectly crisp outside and fluffy inside. The only disappointment was the over seasoning of the food, as all savoury courses and gravy did seem VERY salty. We would have preferred a less salty taste and felt thirsty for several hours after eating. Also, identifying allergies or dietary requirements was not determined upfront by staff, when ordering or any mention. For example, one fish main course arrived at the table with a gravy already poured over the( enormous) yorkshire pudding, and we had to query with the waitress if the gravy was meat free. Which was confirmed. Desserts were excellent, with interesting menu choices, and, again, generous portions. We would return, as the overall experience was enjoyable, but maybe to try the evening menu next time..",1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

The flavours are also great too, with quite a range to choose from. My only gripe with this place is that the mango and lime tasted super artificial. I mean, when I was eating my mango and lime wings, I could quite literally feel the grains of powdered flavour on my tongue. The marinade tasted really grainy.

The lemon pepper was neither particularly lemony or peppery, each BBQ flavour was very similar to the next and all of them were too sweet. Chips were nice. Customer service was awful!

"A bit overpriced, but still tasty. We were a bit cautious coming here on a visit, seeing it used to have a Michelin star( as plastered across the windows) but no longer has it. However the starters were excellent and convinced us to stay for a main course. Unfortunately this fell a little short for me, but no doubt it was still good quality. To start we had the soft shell crab and yakitori. Yakitori were pretty standard, on a par with just about every other place we've had it, but they're so good as it is. The crab on the other hand was excellent, delicate flavour and cooked to perfection. For mains we had the korean sizzling barbecue which came with far too few( 3) leaves of lettuce wrap up all the meat. It came with rice as well though, so probably this was by design However rice was served with flat plates which was a bit awkward. I found the meat itself lacking a bit of flavour, it was n't marinated and the accompanying sauce portion was a bit small. We also had the special 10-piece sushi selection which was somewhat hit and miss. The eel, octopus and suf clam were excellent, while the scallop was a bit gritty and did n't have any smoky flavour you'd expect given the torched presentation. Overall it was undoubtedly a good meal, but I can see why the michelin star rating is conspicuously missing after 2019. The price was also I felt too high, our bill came in at 77, which if it had been more like 50 I would have been perfectly happy.",1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

The funghi aranchini was spot on and so was the calamari fritto. The main course were a bit of a let down. The pizza( Fiorentina) tasted like something from a supermarket.

"By far the worst McDonald we've ever experienced. We ordered just over 30 of food for home delivery. It arrived, absolutely stone cold, not just cold, but like it had been prepared hours ago. One of the burgers was outside of the box, loose in the bag, and so was the bun that was with it. The drive thru needs to be experienced to be believed. Fries are often placed upside down in the bag, rarely do you get napkins and you'd think they might add straws when you order drinks. Every item needs to be checked before you drive away. Raw fries was one of the best experiences; I do n't mind waiting, but at least cook the food. Because it is generally food to go, it is meant to be convenient and fast; not much point being fast if the quality is c * * * and then the customer has to park up, take the items back and get them replaced. There is no quality control, nobody cares about what they are churning out. It is fast becoming a joke as a specific' restaurant'. Please note this is not about McDonalds overall; just this specific outlet. I do n't think we'll opt to use it again, but I doubt they care about that anyway.",0,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

I seen some instructors taking action and making attendees sign a registry to confirm they are booked for the session & fine those who do n't show up.

They had an impressive selection of drinks, from local ales to cocktails and non-alcoholic options. It catered to different tastes, making it a great spot for a group with diverse preferences. The only reason I'm not giving it a full 5-star rating is that while the drinks and service were excellent, the food menu was a bit limited, and some of the dishes we ordered were just average.

It was definitely busy and lively and looked like a very popular spot in central Bath. The food was very good, tasty, good portions and well priced. My one and only complaint with the food was that the bottom burger bun was a bit soggy. Otherwise the burger was great! The only reason the' service' received 4 stars was because we had to chase things up. The drinks order came incompete and so did the food order. The staff were polite enough but it appeared as if some things were forgotten. No biggie, plus the drinks / food came out quickly once we chased them up. The downstairs area is dog-friendly and there were plenty of water bowls around. Overall really enjoyed our visit!",1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

"Update: I tried the chicken Teriyaki which was nice. But I ordered the Korean Fried Chicken... it was not Korean fried Chicken! It was bits of thigh meat( bit chewy, should have used breast) in plain batter! When I asked about it I was told the Korean fried wings are covered in the typical Korean chilli sauce and I assume sesame seeds etc... so how can you call it "" Korean fried "" chicken if it's just in plain batter ?!! I was n't even offered any condiments / Sriracha etc. Very disappointed... I think it was 5 for 5 small bits of chewy chicken thigh meat in batter. Was n't nice anyway!----Better food quality than Kokorro but more expensive. Better food quality maybe because I think they cook to order on some dishes.

There's a small costume section, some stuffed birds, an Egyptian section with a mummy and a mummified head, but the best part, in my opinion obviously, was the art gallery with the biggest collection of donated wood prints by the famous master Japanese Ukiyo-e artist Utagawa Hiroshige from 19th century, including the Great Wave and Red Fuji.

"The culinary journey at this restaurant is nothing short of extraordinary. From the moment you take your first bite, you're enveloped in a symphony of flavors that captivate the senses. Let's start with the salted chicken  tender pieces of chicken marinated in a delicate blend of spices and salt, resulting in a dish that is both succulent and flavorful. Each bite reveals layers of complexity, with the seasoning perfectly complementing the natural sweetness of the chicken. Next up is the seafood rice, a dish that transports you to the shores of distant seas with its bounty of fresh seafood. Succulent shrimp, tender squid, and plump mussels mingle with fragrant rice, creating a harmonious fusion of land and sea. Every spoonful is a delight, with the flavors of the ocean dancing on your palate. And then there's the confit duck, a masterpiece of culinary craftsmanship. The duck is slow-cooked to perfection, resulting in meat that is meltingly tender and imbued with rich, savory flavors. The skin is rendered to a crispy perfection, providing the perfect contrast to the luscious meat beneath. But it's not just the individual dishes that shine; it's the meticulous attention to detail that elevates the dining experience to new heights. Each ingredient is carefully sourced and expertly prepared, ensuring that every dish is a masterpiece in its own right. With prices ranging from 9-10 per dish, this restaurant offers exceptional value without compromising on quality. And with the added incentive of a 50 % discount on your next visit when you keep your receipt, there's even more reason to indulge in this culinary delight.",1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

Only downside for the room was the radiator( or something else) that was making cloud clicking noises all night, making it really hard to sleep.

You can learn a lot from Burger King with properly cooked meals golden arches. Also the scented palm oil that golden arches are known use really smells and impacts food negatively especially when the food temperature drops and gets cold as palm oil is solid at room temperature. As with many mainstream burger chains and franchises I find the burgers not served up to 71c cooking temperature.

The food fell extremely short of our expectations as we had heard good things about the place. The cheesy chicken donner stir fry looked like it had been fermenting for a week and was warmed up upon request. An unappetising concoction of congealed inedible food. The whole portion was just one giant blob, it made no sense. We left still feeling hungry as we barely touched anything( other than the chips). The service left a lot to be desired and there seemed to only be two young girls left to tend to approximately 7 or 8 tables so the service was very slow indeed. While I had nice things to say about the decor, the temperature inside was comparable to the outside( we visited late Feb) as the AC was blasting out cold air constantly.

"I ordered takeout from Amigos and savored their exquisite spread, featuring the renowned Boss burger alongside peri-salted chips and chili cheese bites. The Boss burger was a culinary delight, boasting succulent, perfectly cooked medium-rare meat complemented by a harmonious blend of fried egg and turkey strips, imparting a delightful smoky essence with every bite. Though I usually prefer seeded buns to sweeter brioche, Amigos' choice did n't detract from the overall gastronomic experience. The peri-peri salted chips were executed flawlessly, retaining their crispiness and infused with a flavorful seasoning that avoided any hint of sogginess. Moving on to the chili cheese bites, despite a slightly elevated saltiness, they outshone counterparts found elsewhere with their delightfully gooey melted cheese, offering a satisfying contrast of textures and flavors. However, the highlight of this culinary journey was undoubtedly the Reese Pieces milkshake. This decadent treat boasted a creamy texture, elevated by the perfect fusion of peanut butter, chocolate, and premium-quality ice cream. Each sip offered a symphony of flavors that tantalized the taste buds and left a lasting impression. In conclusion, my takeaway experience from Amigos, a halal establishment, was exceptional. Every element was meticulously crafted to delight even the most discerning of palates.

"Came for a cocktail, a pint and some nibbles with my partner. Drinks: We each got the same cocktail, the Pop Tart. I know that some cocktails are short, but this one was REALLY short. In the picture attached, you can see the tiny glasses with the single massive ice cube each in them. Those are the glasses used for the cocktail. Yes, with that colossal ice cube. The cocktail was nice, but nothing special. Definitely not worth 13! Pints are on the standard high-end side, I believe about 7 a pint. Nice lager. Food: we got the pork bao buns, tuna tostadas, and padron peppers. The pork bao were nice. The tostadas were very mild, different to what I expected. They were Japanese inspired more than mexican-a very interesting taste. Worth a try. The padron peppers were the star of the show-great value for money in terms of portion size compared to the others( which makes sense, as it's just battered peppers) but they're DELICIOUS! Interior: cute decor. The bathrooms had a really unique design with a high ceiling of hanging plants and an amphora-like sink. It is impressive enough for me to bother mentioning. Staff / service: the staff were lovely. Special shout-out to the guy( sorry, did n't get your name) working on the evening of the 9th of April. He was extra friendly and really delivered that attitude that puts customers at ease and makes them feel welcome. This venue may be more suited for a professional meeting, special occasion or maybe just for punters who earn more than I do! But, as a hospitality worker myself, a bit too pricey to be worth it for a long stay, considering the products. I would still come back here for the delicious Padron peppers and a pint.",1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment
Lovely place to pop into for delicious food. The Salmon Salad is a favourite of mine. Service is always polite and friendly. Needed to use my torch on my phone to read the menu when you go at night!

"The drinks we had( cocktails) were more expensive compared to other places by about 2 on average. Which adds up very quickly. The set menu for lunch was really tasty, but most of the options have an additional charge, which makes you wonder why they bother with the set price so low, increase it slightly and makes the food choices standard. My friend who accompanied me was vegan and she also only had 1 option for her food choices, and the only vegan dessert had an extra charge as well, which I thought was unfair. The waitress did offer extra of something as my friend did n't like something on the only main meal option though, which I thought was nice. Overall though we all had a really lovely time. The decor was high end. The service was prompt and efficient. The food was super tasty and the cocktails were delicious. 4 * from me!",1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

"Tynemouth Priory and Castle is like stepping into a time machine with its ancient ruins and stunning coastal views. Exploring the priory feels like diving into a history book  you can practically hear the echoes of monks chanting. And climbing up the castle walls ? It's like being on top of the world, with panoramic views of the rugged coastline that'll take your breath away. But let's not forget about the beach! The surrendering beach area below is like something out of a postcard. With its sandy shores and dramatic cliffs, it's the perfect spot for a leisurely stroll or a day of soaking up the sun. Overall, Tynemouth Priory and Castle is a must-visit if you're in the area.

Atmosphere The interior is picturesque and has great lighting but when we got in, there were still used plates on a table or two. The table beside us was sprayed with cleaning agent and was just left there it began to sting my eyes. Had to remind our host to please wipe off what he sprayed on it. Food The starter was just ok. The skewers were n't well seasoned and I made mention of it. The linguine pasta was cold and so oily. There were no sauces or dips at all and when i asked for chilli I was served mild sriracha sauce swimming in oil The food was so greasy I used up our serviettes wiping oil off my mouth. My husband asked for tomato sauce and was served ketchup Had to force our way through it because we were very hungry. I told the host I did n't enjoy it. We wanted to order desserts and asked for the menu infact but the main was so bad, we called it a wrap there. Other The menu is very limited.

There was a technical problem that delayed our entrance, resulting in a 40 minute wait but it seemed to go quickly. I could have done without the drop in temperature though. The' show' comprises of projected Christian images onto the walls and ceiling, with a specially composed soundtrack. I actually enjoyed the music as much, or possibly more than the images. It lasted around 15 mins and the room was not over crowded so all had a good view. The imagery felt a bit random despite the theme, and some of it was abstract. I think it would have been more powerful if it had told a story. Strangely I thought the setting was a distraction but that's probably just me. The show was enjoyable and very competitively pricef but I am not sure if it's something that you would see more than once.",1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

"I do n't think the lady who greeted us understood we had booked. I kept saying we have booked. She kept saying table for two. She put us on a table right next to the toilet away from others, up a step and away from the nicely set tables. Our table had any old serviettes where other empty tables were red and beautifully folded. There were filthy windows at the back of restaurant to one side of us. Huge cobwebs hung at the side of fireplace where a skirting board held it up along with cobwebs between a Christmas tree and storm lamp on the fireplace-it is now May! There were Christmas lights on the logs in the fire well. The fireplace itself looks like it came out of a local dumpit site. This place did not have any of the drinks I chose-medication stops me having alcohol, so I had to have water. My caprese salad came without balsamic vinegar so I got up to ask for it. The lasagne was 2 inches square-the smallest I've ever seen!!! It was swimming in tomato sauce. The penne dish went cold quickly and was soon dried up. When the food arrived the waiter shouted at us not spoke, then thanked us in GERMAN ? ? ? We are Yorkshire through and through. We had to get up again to ask for desert menu and chose one but could we have two spoons please. The waitress forgot what we wanted so came back. When we went to the bar to pay, the bill was not ready. Some tables were still not occupied when we had finished. We were glad to leave.",0,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

I believe one of the owners even came to our table and asked how everything was and they explained about how they source their meat. As I said the sheesh lounge aesthetic did ruin it a little for me. I had to shout in order for my friends to hear me and vice versa. It's difficult to find parking mind especially if you're coming from outside of Coventry. Just bare that in mind.

Church is locked outside of service hours. It's a central part of the community and is closed off to said community most of the time.

However most of the congregation nearer the front of the church are lovely as are the alter servers.,0,en-UK,Google,Sentiment
"Restaurant needs a bit more lighting, re-paint to be something vibrant and not dull grey, ambience feels very dull and boring. Food is reasonable, Chicken Biryani and Beef Nihari were of good taste and the portion size was decent too, but they serve in open pots with no lid so food gets cold quickly. Also, not sure it they use too much turmeric in biryani or it was some cheap food colour that left pretty stubborn yellow stains on my fingers and nails( I eat using my hand following Sunnah). They have a sign on till saying they take cash only, but you can do bank transfer to them as well. They have floor sitting I think for families as they have curtains but they are useless being see through and across the tables, so it is an awkward view especially with family if you using floor seating and people sitting on chair oppsite to you side stare at you directly due to the position of seatings.",0,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

There was a great crunch from the veg, the sauce was spicy, numbing and a little funky which was delicious. Kept having more! Etles spicy trotters: the sauce on this is truly exceptional, I personally love the texture of trotters so I really enjoyed this dish, maybe something for the more adventurous eaters as my friend did n't like the texture( but still loved the sauce).

She was short with customers, quickly rattled off choices, sighed and tutted, just pointed quickly when asked where something was and was actually abit brutal to a young male waiter who possibly had less experience, but certainly had a better attitude. Sorry, but for me a pleasant manner is so important.

The management team was extremely accommodating of our needs and allowed me time to set up the tables and area of dining how I wished. Provided me with an extra table for the cake. We pre ordered our food, which made the evening run amazingly, and the bill was paid before the guests arrived. It's definitely an easier way to do it. The staff who served us were also extremely efficient, and food came out at great speed when needed. The manageress attended to us so well even when there was a small issue with a meal. I personally spoke to her at the end of the evening and gave my personal feedback, which she took on board. I would point out that the One star review awared by another guest, my father, was unjustified and not a true reflection of the whole night.

We were never asked if everything was okay, infact we had to all but pin down the staff who did their best to avoid us.

"Alright, I have seen some negative and positive reviews regarding Superbowl in Barnsley but in fairness I think some are a little harsh to say the least. The Superbowl is on the second floor within the complex and you have great wheel chair access via the two lifts upon entry. For those that like to take the staircase there steps too. Once you get inside of the room where the Superbowl bowling, Arcade and Crazy Club Play area your met with large room that reminds me of walking into an arcade at the seaside, including the noises of the machines. They also had some good music playing whilst people bowled. Have to say personally I love the look and feel of the place. This place is going to be popular with families, kids and teens through the holidays. My daughter who is 2 years old played inside the Crazy Club Play Area for 2 hours straight. Albeit we initially attended at 9 am it turns out Barnsley Super Bowl does n't open until 10 am on Weekdays now and Google or their website has n't been updated to reflect this so make sure you check opening times before you go. I would suggest calling them until this information is reflected on the Internet. The play area is of adequate size but again beware that it is n't the largest play area and on a weekends I was told it gets super busy, so weekdays are best as it was almost empty until 11 am when we went. The entire place is pretty good, the food is alright but nothing special but the staff are lovely and very personable and hopefully it will only get better as the place ages. You can get food and soft drinks in both the play area and main room and in all honesty this is reasonable in price. There are plenty of toilets at the location and I have to say anyone I saw inside Superbowl Barnsley appeared to have a smile on their face. I try my luck with one of the grabbers to win a Ghostbusters teddy and did n't managed to win one ha! Maybe next time. I have attached some pictures of our day at the complex.

"An older hotel which is in the perfect location. Good for a weekend away, but it is feeling a little old. Rooms are comfortable and clean. Some are fabulously large with great views. Parking in Brighton is VERY expensive, 8 / hour in some places. Take a train or park on the outskirts and use the cheap buses. Good food, but as Brighton suffers from huge influxes of tourists when the sun comes out the bar can struggle on the hotter days. But the large street patio and sea facing rooms are fabulous to watch the world go by, or to use a base for days out on the seafront a, Lanes or Kemptown.",1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

Thankfully, we had cleaning wipes with us and did our own cleaning before the food arrived.",1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

We had some really lovely food, the menu has are real range of options for every one and some great vegan options. I was really happy with the Vegan Lasagne and the dessert was the highlight. The only downside I would say is that you constantly have Uber eats / Delivery Drivers coming through the restaurant that are pushing past you at the table, alongside leaving the door open so when your seated near the front door your constantly getting cold so having to get up to close the door. It definitely ruins the atmosphere when you trying to enjoy your meal.",1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

"Popped into this place for a meal( lunch). Found the app too annoying to use so I ordered the old school way( at the bar). Plenty of spaces if you like spacious fine dining. I opted to sit near the escape doors at the back of the venue as the last time I was in the same venue it got pretty ugly, and although this time my visit was during the day, I opted for safety over risk. Anyway. It is very cheap. Two meals and two drinks for just over 10. That's fantastic if you're on a budget, however, my meal was n't edible. Additionally, the staff who served the meals practically threw the dishes at us, now, I'm not sure if she was practising her discuss throwing skills or she was just having a bad day; either way, it kept me on my toes within regards to catching the plate. I did need the toilet whilst there. The journey to the ladies took me as far as Peterlee, I'm sure, but the toilets were very clean, if not as cold as a mortuary. The back is quite pleasing on the eye. I can imagine it being busy and adventurous in the summer. Best thing about my visit here was definitely leaving. Interesting experience nonetheless.",0,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

Ignored upon entry, very quiet, got a table with a view, dog hairs on the seat, no menu, so had to ask for one. Picked a sharing platter for 2 of us, not enough for a child!! Tiny portion with 3x3 miniature pieces and 2 dips. Had to cut one in half to share and a tiny side salad. Not what we expected and definitely not a sharing platter. We told the waitress, who said she'd tell the chef, who obviously did n't care. The only good thing is the view. We do not recommend it.",0,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

"I visited the ODEON on New Street for the first and possibly last time depending on film availability in the area. I imagine the experience is completely different from an able bodied perspective but as a wheelchair user this was a challenge for sure. To start there is n't really anywhere that close that's reliably available for disabled people. Some street parking is n't far away but it's a gamble if you're going for that route and tight on time for your movie. The cinema itself from the outside can easily be mistaken for a coffee shop with the scaffolding in place currently and the ODEON sign obscured. The entrance is fine but two sets of stairs down to the screen my film was showing in posed a small problem. I say small because without much of a chance to see if the lifts provided could be used independently I do n't know if you can make it down to that area without assistance. The biggest positive came from the staff who were very helpful and operated the lifts for me on both occasions without fuss or delay. One drawback is you can only fit one chair user in at a time and as I said I could n't try myself to see if you can use them without aid. The disabled toilet was disgusting, it did n't look like it had been cleaned all weekend( This was at 5 pm Sunday) and was quite small so not much room to maneuver. If you were somebody who needed a carer inside with you I can imagine it would be very troublesome. Then I made my way to screen 4 which on the website looked magnificent from the seating plan. A rare reserved area at the back in the middle for me to park in which was ideal. Unlike the usual options of front row and or on one side. The issue for me came with opening the door as there is a slope leading into the screen. Because of this I nearly ended up out the chair several times as my feet slipped out the chair due to leaning forward to open and try and get through the door. The quality of the screen was fine and everything outside the toilets was clean. Personally however I would not recommend this cinema to anyone else with mobility issues especially. It would be a case of needs must for me to visit again.",0,en-UK,Google,Sentiment
"Took my nippers there as an arranged half term thing. I was very much looking forward to it with the promise of a huge selection of retro games on offer and the kids were keen to try out the vr and ps5 etc. It was very quiet when we arrived. With us( 4) there were probably only another 3 kids there. The retro games were on 2 arcade machines. They were tiny though. A modern arcade machine not like the ones in the arcadea when I was young. I'm sure these ones use a lot less power but when 2 people try to play at the same time, you really are squished in close and generally it's hard to play. Some. A good selection of Street Fighter games( sonic boom!) and some other games. I was. Very happy to see joust on one of the machines. Love that game and wasted a lot of my youth playing that. The kids played on the Nintendo Wii but there was no vr to be seen. Maybe it's hidden out of sight and you have to ask for it. The kids fired up the Xbox but it only had 1 controller so they could n't play together which was a shame. A huge selection of board games were available which was ace too.

We tried this Italian restaurant in Ruislip for a late brunch and were impressed with their two course early bird menu which is very good value at 14 per person and delivers in terms of food quality. I went for the parmigiana to start which was well balanced and simply scrumptious. For my main I tried the rigatoni alla boscailo which was a mushroom pasta with a gorgonzola and cream sauce. Vegetarian pasta frequently disappoints especially when on a set menu but this certainly did not.

"First visit here in years-still got it. Located bang in the middle of Upper Street Angel North London. Despite it being in the middle of winter, we still fancied something cold and sweet. There was such a good variety of flavours, from birthday cake to pistachio to mango sorbet to their monthly special, cinnamon roll. Love that it's all clearly labelled, and that there's vegan flavours too. As I was the only person in the queue, staff really took her time with me, explaining the flavours and allowing me to taste them too. We ended going for two regular scoops(), the pistachio and oreo chocolate cheesecake which was also her favourite too. We also ordered two smaller scoops() of the birthday cake and chocolate, you ca n't go wrong with this really, can you ? Also an Americano, which we added some of the ice cream in, new twist. Great that you have the option of scoop size. There were also options for toppings too. Tasted fresh with amazing flavours, creamy and rich but not too sweet either, just right.

"At first glance, you notice black coloured rooms that highlights the certain atmosphere and the colour style of the place making it pretty cozy to be in. However, I would add a bit more decorations to fulfill this feeling. The food itself is amazing in my opinion: it is fully packed with tasty filling which also destroys your hunger by just eating one full meal. I liked the wide range of options especially for fries, where you could choose one from 4 types of the fries. The fillings of the kebab I had are decently harmonically combined. Price are relatively low, considering that the ood is worthy. I payed 11 pounds for kebab, fries and a drink. Nothing special about the service. Although, I am really good in speaking English, the one who took my order was patient enough to repeat some questions to me. There are take-aways available No parking places A lot of space inside, so it's not difficult to find a place to sit. Decent lights.

"I had this place on my list for a while now. I took the opportunity to book it as a surprise meal for me and my wife A stunning restaurant, with a great ambient atmosphere. We got a nice warm welcome and service was offered pretty quickly as opposed to having to wait around. It did n't take long and the restaurant was ' buzzing ', it filled up pretty quick which is always a good sign. The menu is very good with extensive options, including a tapas option. The drinks Menu is excellent, including non-alcoholic drinks and Mocktails. We tried the scallops which we never tried before, definitely a hit! This was whilst we waited for our main meal which we were told would be a 40min wait.( At least we knew it was getting cooked fresh). My wife had the steak and I had the Lamb. I never tried a lamb dish like this, a very different way of serving Lamb, a dish I enjoyed, but sadly would n't order again. The gravy was far too thin / watery and the chef evidently likes to use the signature pea sauce. The chips with the peppercorn sauce along with the steak complimented each other well. A Beautiful combination. There are many attractive options on the menu, so even if you picky there is something for everyone. The dessert Menu has some great options too. Being a diabetic I did n't want to risk it but definitely would have had the white chocolate pudding. Sadly, right next to our table one of the customers passed out. The Restaurant staff were very accommodating and helpful. They did n't make a fuss but assisted in getting some help for the young individual. The downside was staff put on the air-con to provide the customer with some cool air, which then meant the rest of the restaurant and food would be affected.( Go Cold) All in all, a great experience, I ca n't fault it. Beautiful Menu, great atmosphere, very good staff and definitely worth it.",1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

Service was neither here nor there. Average, no problems. It seems like a nice place overall, but they could do with getting the details right.

"Was my friends 21st birthday yesterday. His parents booked him a table at Cosmos Sheffield, invited family from Portugal and a few close friends. We were 21 in total. The table was booked well over a month ago.... When we all arrived at Cosmos sheffield, the restaurant was near enough empty. So many tables available, however, they sat us all on the sofa bit, meaning with all the tables together we was not able to stand and get our food whenever we wanted without disturbing the person sat next to us. My friend spoke to the manager and all the manager said was to not put the tables together so we could easily get in / out. We had no other option to do this! Meaning that we could n't speak to each others. We were so far away from our friends:- it was basically eat and go home, we've travelled from Grimsby to be with them to have a meal with them, to socialize a bit and that did not happen. The children could n't be sat together either due to this. My friend even asked the manager if we could move to a different table seen as there was so many empty tables. He asked if the other tables right in front of us could be turned, all he got was a no no no, as due to the room layout etc. Did not offer us a solution at all! I mean it's a BUFFET, who would come with such an idea of sofas ? He tried again, explaining how important this dinner was, that he ai n't seen his family for a while, or us and still there was not a solution... and that was it, we all had our food whilst sat away from everyone. There was more customers complaining for exact same reason, a group that was split in 2.... just really bad planning! We've been customers for so many years, Cosmos is my favourite restaurant. And so we try and come with the children at least twice a month and yesterday with what I've witnessed I think we have all had a change of heart. Really awful! On top of all this, they've charged my 12 year old son as an adult and my small 4 year old son almost 12. My friend was supposed to have his meal free as it was his birthday and he had his ID on him and also was mentioned when the table was booked and surprise, surprise.... ended up paying for it! Thr manager was rude and definitely not helpful at all! All he wanted was us all sat eating quietly, out money and goodbye! Horrible experience!

"Food is great always fresh and tasty however today my mum wanted to order a pizza for herself she went into the store her total order was under 10 they told her she could n't pay by card as it has to be 10 or more and had to add more to her order.( She only had her card on her which is why she could n't pay by cash). She ended up paying 20 for her total order. However, about 3 weeks ago I went into the store and ordered only curly fries which were less than 5 and paid by card. Not happy about this as I really do enjoy the food but not happy about having to pay more",0,en-UK,Google,Sentiment
"For such a large space, you have a small but delicious buffet selection. To be honest I was a little concerned when we went for dinner. The buffet service looked pretty small and I wonder how they would cope when full booked. Thankfully, only a handful of happy dinners where in with us. Despite the limited selection, the taste is spot on. Every dish was unique and you could see the chefs preparing each dish in the open plan kitchen. Food was replenished almost continuously and thre quality is way ahead of a lot of other buffets. The only let down was the desert and single vat of half empty vanilla ice cream and a few portions of fruit on the salad bar. So go for the main meals. In particular the Nepalese hot counter with delicious regional curries. Best of the best and the other hot plates are yummy too",1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

"The pizza here is consistently excellent. Having visited before, I can attest that they never fail to impress. The menu offers a variety of gourmet pizzas, including vegetarian options. Although the selection is relatively small, I often find myself torn between choices due to the diverse array of high-quality ingredients. Occasionally, they feature a special of the day, although it not available every day. On the dessert front, the tiramisu is good, though not as standout as the pizza, and it on the smaller side. While I did n't try the coffee, I notice the young server craft a cappuccino for a colleague, and it looked quite nice. The restaurant is quite small, which adds to its charm, but may be challenging to find seating, especially during weekends.

Were plenty of tables on arrival and walk-ins were seated after. Took quite a while for someone to greet on arrival, despite two staff noticing quickly they did n't tell front of house. 2-music just too loud. Hard to order, one item wrong as a result but rectified quickly and taken off bill. Had work to have a conversation and everyone shouting as a result making it even louder. 3-salmon dish quite small( cold item) Good overall, with a few tweaks could be very good. Personal preference; crisp the Bravas, make mussel sauce less fishy, swap wrap for bread. Check out the dining room at left of bar, through the old safe door.

"This has to have been the worst Hotel, l have had the misfortune to stay in, post Covid! On arrival, l was given a room on the second floor. The room was opposite the lift shaft and looked out on a flat roof and the air conditioning units, but, it was the cleanliness, or lack of it, l struggled with! It was n't the hairs and fluff in the sink, or the long grey hair and fluff on the chair that sent me running back to reception, but, the hairs in the bed! At reception l apologised for complaining, but said l could n't sleep in a dirty bed. After a few visits to the room behind reception, the receptionist came back and assigned me a room on the third floor, almost directly above the first one! I duly moved to be met with a' punishment room, nowhere to sit, work, or put any of my toiletries, clothes etc, that is once l found somewhere to actually be able to open my case! However, l did n't even get that far, due to a check of the bed and the presence of hairs, photos attached. I returned to reception, where l found myself apologising again and where the receptionist made it clear she was exasperated with me and basically asked me what l expected her to do with a full hotel! I explained that l would be happy just to have the sheets changed. Eventually, this is exactly what happened, the bed was changed by one of the other receptionists in the first room. So, l returned to the second floor, where l never sat in the chair or managed to work out how to stop the air conditioning unit blowing out hot air! The toilets in reception and outside the restaurant left a lot to be desired and at one time only one toilet was working, as the others would not flush. We had set meal times, yesterday evening was supposed to be at 1830 hours, but, we were n't allowed in until 1925 hours, which messed up a drinks reception, due to commence in the bar area at 1930 hours, all of which had been arranged, with the hotel, weeks in advance! The food itself was n't particularly great, especially on the first evening, although, in fairness, lunch on both days, was much better. To finish it all off, this morning a few people found their cars had been broken into, windows smashed, vehicles damaged, overnight in the car park.

It's the third( and last!) time I've been-it took 2 hours for a simple lunch and it was n't even busy. Dreadful service, had to ask the wait staff to come and take our order, waited ages for food to arrive, one meal did n't come out until 10 mins after everyone else, we tidied the table ourselves and they got the bill wrong at the end. Not a good experience.",0,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

Nicer experience than most supermarkets. The aisles are very wide so even when busy it does n't seem like it is. Fresh fruit and veg at good prices. Named Brands are cheaper than elsewhere but they do less of their own brand products so depending on what you normally purchase it can both increase and decrease your usual cost. Still a long way to go to compete with the likes of Aldi but there's far more variety and it has longer opening hours.,1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

The haddock was very good but the rest of the food was bad, it's hard to tell wether the food was not cooked right, the quality of food was poor or because we had to reheat it.

When they food came the chicken was really dry and bland as though they did n't baste or season it on the grill.

We are n't complainers so we did n't say anything until we seen the manager at the very end. All he said was OK I'll let the staff know. I think maybe some of the order was ready and was waiting too long before serving which is why everything was dry and almost stale. It honestly is not worth the money, far too expensive and food very inadequette. Even the children said how bad it was. We wo n't be returning sadly.

"This us a very old building with floors, staircases and rooms that would not be suitable for someone disabled or old. On entering there is a bar on either side of the lobby that looks like a furniture shop. There was no one at the reception desk as she was chatting tk a bar man next door! Keys were given in an envelope but nothing else. We had to go back down 3 flights of stairs to find out the Wi-Fi code and also when breakfast was served. The room was very pretty but was not the one promised, we had a view of the kitchen vents / ducts which were quite noisy. Bed very comfortable, still and sparkling water and range of teas on tap. We were woken by rave music, very loud underneath our room that lasted for about 30 minutes. On telling reception she informed us that the kitchen does not have a sound system so it could not have been them. Breakfast room was a rabbit Warren away from where we were told, three members of staff, one being the initial receptionist were there. She appeared in the same dress as the day before but with tights that were ripped and laddered over both thighs. We sat and waited and then had to ask the youngest young lady if we could have some drinks, she was not confident at all and had to ask the other waitress if that was OK, no other was taken until we asked the waitress( who was busy doing most of the work) eventually we had our breakfast and it was good.

Unfortunately the staff take it upon themselves to add their own tip to the bill, on the receipt it does state it is an optional service charge though there is no option to remove this.

Both meals come with a side of your choice. I got chunky chips, my son ordered skinny fries and we both ordered a side of pepper sauce. The beef burger was nice, but slightly overcooked for my preference and could have used a relish or sauce on the burger because it was quite dry, though a mayo style dip is provided on the side. No complaints on the chicken burger from my son!

Update 3 * I went to see Matilda at 3 pm on the 1st of December the film was good but felt let down by the quality of the sound was really flat with minimal bass especially on a musical film. I paid the extra for the premier seats whilst being a different colour and a slightly higher back they really ai n't comfortable and I was starting to ache so had to keep moving about in my seat to get through the film whilst the seats look good the comfort was n't considered when they were made especially for sitting in for around 2 hours. The picture quality was really good with good brightness level. I did notice there was an intermittent image reflection at the top right hang corner on the dark border around the screen which showed part of the image at times during the film which when I noticed it kept taking my focus away from the film. I really would like to see different straws available as the straws currently just go soggy and collapse around 20 minutes into the film I had 2 and had failed before I finished my large drink I ended up using a spare straw when I got back to my car I had from showcase wich lasted well for the rest of the drink This cinema is good but I would n't use it as my first choice as cinemas are a big part of me and the sound image and comfort are really important things to me for a great cinema experience. I do really like the screens outside so you can check the film that's showing before you go in it's a great idea and works well( picture taken as I left so shows film time of the showing after the one I watched) Original 4 * I have n't been to a cinema in around 13 years i enjoyed my visit the person serving was friendly and really helpful we got are tickets and drinks we went for the large drinks because hey it's not a regular thing and might aswell go all out on it. The person scanning tickets could have been a bit more helpful I rely on things being made clear to me and because I seen the sign for screen one and not screen to as that was around the corner under the stairs it was difficult for me to understand wear it was the the person was friendly it would have been helpful to maby word and explain things a little different as some of us struggle with things like this also maybe move the sign for screen 2 so it can be seen as easy as screen 1 from wear the tickets get checked. The cinema was clean tidy and I really enjoyed the film we did notice that about of the way through many the Aircon came on or heating went off and started to get cold.

"My friend and I parked in the Bromley Sainsbury car park today and visited the high street which I have not visited for 20 years. Needless to say I did not recognise much. After a quick walk and nice lunch, we returned to sainsbury which I saw to be a familiar site due to the brand. But I realised here too things were very different. This is the first time I have ever been to this brach. So I got the Sainsbury app up on my and after speaking to the security guard, located the point where I scanned the store location barcode. My phone app was up and ready. Due to limited time as we had to go elsewhere, my friend and I picked up some items which I scanned on my phone and we were ready to check out. Unlike my local Sainsburys in Essex, this Sainsbury did not have a separate checkout for people with prescanned times on their phone. In fact, I did not come across any hand held scanners in the store, if they were there, they certainly were not easily visible when one enters the store. So I queued up with people who were just using self checkout and scanning their items one by one where as I already had prescanned items. This just caused unnecessary delay for us and so wasted our time. After transfering the scanned receipt across to the till using the barcode, I paid for the shopping. We then took our baskets to the parking meter and scanned the till receipt barcode. Nothing was happening and the machine was not reading the barcode. So we asked the person next to us using the machine how to scan the receipt. The person advised us that we have to go inside and get a separate parking receipt. How absolutely idiotic. So I went in and queued up for a considerable time where it said customer services. Unfortunately there was no one at the customer services counter, picture attached. There was a person to the left of customer services, serving customers Tobacco and Lottery with baling queue. Eventually it was my turn and I got the parking ticket stub. This I took to my friend who scanned it at the machine. We wasted so much unnecessarily time queling for the pre scanned basket checkout on my app as well as the time wasted looking for and queling for the separate parking voucher. My friend better not get a parking ticket. As a store, in line with efficiency, you should seriously look at setting up a separate checkout for pre scanned baskets for people using Sainsbury app. You should also be given the parking voucher when checking out the shopping at the till or at least be advised by someone or a big highlighted sign that you need to get another piece of paper from customer services that will be required at the parking meter before you exit the store. Also you really need to man the Customer Services counter and not leave it unattended So many staff members went past this counter but no one thought it necessary or had the foresight to put a serving member there to relieve the queue at the Tobacco and Lottery counter, the lady there seemed to be the only one a totally working and serving the customers.

We both ordered the tonkotsu ramen and have to say this is the best ramen we've ever had. The broth was very tasty, the noodles were nice, the meat was a bit thin but good, and the best part was the boiled egg! The best boiled egg I've ever had! So flavorful.

"Me and partner visited the Tim Hortons in Golden Square Warrington around today which is a Sunday. It was our first time at this particular Tim Hortons, I've never been to any Tim full stop so this was my first experience. When we arrived it was busy but not rammed, there was a queue for food' collection' which was awkwardly set up as there's not enough room to form a neat organised line and you end up waiting around people tables and there's a table in the way of collection also. So that side of things was a bit awkward and the self serve machines were in the middle of the entire room which I'm adamant does n't work in food places but they keep doing it. They could be against a wall on one side as a suggestion like some McDonald do but I digress. As we'd never been we used the self serve to figure out what we'd like and the menu were clear and simple, but it was so we could go and order in person as I have a blue light card. The man said Tim accept blue light but kindly mentioned the deal / offer they had on today worked out cheaper so we appreciated that. The food came quick and came hot and we liked the idea that the burgers came in foil as it possibly kept them warmer for longer. I got a meatless chicken sandwich meal and my partner got a chicken sandwich stack meal and we could not fault it the burgers were delicious. Thanks to the deal, for 2 meals it cost us just under 15. All in all we had a good first experience and on this visit would recommend. The low rating for atmosphere was due to the self serve machines and collection point being where they are, when people were waiting they all seemed a but stressed.

My guest had Calamari and then Classic burger and they were both excellent according to his aggressively omnivore diet. I had veggie options. It always makes me laugh when people assume I'm the meat eater out of two. Was n't over keen on the sachets of sauce, for the price. I'd expect a small vessel laden with the best quality sauces. The beer was too fizzy. Not sure that's a criticism! Overall a good, solid experience.",1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

The egg chowmein was not at all upto the mark. It barely had any egg and the taste was It was bland and was lacking taste and texture. Jhol momos are momos that are drowned in a bowl full of broth / gravy. The broth is supposed to be spicy but sadly, at this place, it was not. The texture was grainy and did not feel good in the mouth. Other dishes such as chilly paneer, chicken steamed momos and chicken fried rice was bang on! One weird thing-there was a really tiny pebble( we call it Kankar) when I took my first bite of the fried rice but other than that, the taste of the fried rice was really nice! I would love to go to this place again to try their thaali and fried momos. Majority of the people there were ordering the thaali so can not wait to be there again!

"A rather disappointing Bank Holiday lunch. Although there was a good selection of vegetables, the Chef carving the meat appeared to have the world sharpest knife. One would have expected at least one decent slice of meat and a couple of smaller slices( I chose only Turkey), however, despite there being well over half the turkey on display with lots of meat, he literally shaved five slivers off the base. When we last visited Lincoln, we had a couple of generous slices, sadly when I mentioned this he replied it now on weight. That fine, I understand the business has to make a profit, overheads are a killer, but he did not weigh anything and just guessed at what he was serving up. Our group of four were all shocked as to the amount we received so it was not just myself. On top of that, the restaurant was very quiet with only a handful of filled tables, we sat for nearly half an hour after finishing our meals before the waitress came to our table.

So if you like your spice then this is the one, they had so many options to choose from too. All in all we enjoyed the food and we will be back to try some of the other dishes and noodle boxes!

Overall: Mid way commercial cinema experience between The Everyman and The Odeon. Good for Wimbledon which let face it that despite best efforts is pretty run down and soulless.( I think I speak with reasonable authority having been born and raised in SW19 and seen the downward decline in the name of modernisation over the last 50 years) Expect conventional but reasonably comfortable seats on a slight incline to allow good viewing. You not going to get the luxurious sofa with little tables and high quality seat service like The Everyman but you are a cut above the boring Odeon chain. You feel like you part of something in the middle. You are. Food: Nice selection of snacks. What I liked:  14 per ticket( non member rate)  Reasonable food and drink offering  Colour themed screens  Friendly staff  The have special screenings adapted for those with different requirements.  Good value membership schemes for cinema aficionados What I did n't like:  Over priced popcorn  No one actually checked our tickets on entry so could easily have walked straight in. Conversely this makes me question the security.  Not quite enough of an incline on the seating meaning it was a stretch most of the time to look over peoples heads to read the subtitles Do I recommend going ? YES Will I go again ? YES Was it good value ? Price Point: &,1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

"I like to preface this by saying I had an incredible time at the 80 night and previously at the Frank Sinatra gig performed by the same great people. However, there were people who bought tickets for their family as they were assured through someone higher up that under 18s were allowed and once they got there, any underage people were kicked out despite it being a very family friendly event. If this was because it was an event open to the public let me turn that around and mention the fact that bar staff were not informed that tickets were open to the public and instead, when asked about what the event was were told "" it a private party "". The lack of marketing for this event compared to others was shocking and the fact the people running it rang to check if under 18s were allowed multiple times and they were then turned away was abysmal. For an event this quality with such an intricate amount of attention on detail and organisation, it was disappointing they were treated like this.",0,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

"First time at Hickory last night! The food was incredible! Me and my partner really enjoyed the food and drinks. The service was impeccable, staff incredibly friendly. Will definitely come back. Only thing we were n't too happy about was being seated by a huge table celebrating an 18th birthday party. Our evening was constantly disturbed & the table seemed to think they were the only ones in the restaurant! No awareness for anyone around them. Perhaps huge tables like this could have an area for themselves next time to save us getting constantly knocked by people while trying to enjoy our evening. Other than this everything was amazing.

"What a shame, we were so looking forward to this place but it just did n't live up to expectations at all. It's a nice venue, and service is pretty good albeit a little clinical. We ordered some burgers and sides, the buffalo strips being really good( although they did taste like deep fried chicken soaked in Frank Hot Sauce) and the loaded fries were also good. The issue however was with the burgers... and it's not they really TASTED of it, but they smelt like a cow shed! I get it, it's beef but I want to taste and smell BEEF not COW. It was a mix of meat and... well, cow s * * * as my darling wife put it. It just completely put us off, whether it was a bad batch, or it's meant to be like that I'm not sure but was completely not for us. We left half of our food( see the pic), and no one questioned anything, did n't even ask if everything was okay-just cleared up and brought the bill. We booked for 7 pm-by we were walking out the door having been served, disappointed and paid! Compared to the Beefy Boys, you have a long long way to go, but we really did want to try( and like) somewhere else-it's just not this place, at all. Sorry",0,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

We were ushered to our table and directed to use the QR code to order our food.

I on the other hand can kind of understand what he meant but was ok with the way I ordered the food. I scanned the QR code and ordered and paid for the food via Apple Pay. The food arrived quite quickly and was as ordered. My son again complained that he would have liked someone to tell him where the plates and sauces were. So in a matter of minutes we had three members of staff including the manager asks us if everything was ok. Being British it felt a bit much, but actually they were very polite.

"As a Christmas gift, my wife and I went for an Afternoon Tea. This is something we do every year and we try out the different ones around Tunbridge Wells. Sadly this did not live up to expectations. When we first turned up we were greeted and then told to go to the bistro to check in. We waited there for around 15 minutes before being seen to( nobody else was there). One person walked by and said they would be back but we did n't see them again. When we finally got seen to it felt like we were an inconvenience to their day! We got sat on a table in the window with the sun beating through so I asked if we could sit out of the sun as it was to hot and we wanted to enjoy our Afternoon Tea. When our food arrived we were told what we had on the plates and was then left to it. One of the sweet things were a pair of ice cream balls on sticks, we were advised to eat them quickly before they melted. If we had stayed on the original table they would have melted in a matter of minutes. The sandwich we had felt like they had been made the day before and stored in the fridge until they were served as they were cold and slightly hard and very dry. The scones!!! I do n't think they were cooked right as they were flat and had n't risen. They tasted ok but quite dense. We used up the cream and jam with the first 2 scones so we asked if we could have some more. When it was bought out to us we noticed that the new cream had a slightly odd smell. We tried a little bit and agreed it definitely was n't quite right. When we told them that we thought it might be on its way out they took it back to the kitchen to ask the chef ? We did n't hear what their opinion was ? On the whole I say it was all round a poor experience. With the status this hotel has I definitely expected more.

Seemed to be a lot of bigger groups like ours I imagine doing similar things with work. Service was prompt and good. I have never really been in the casino bit properly before now, and it was really busy. The free bet you get with your meal is restricted to a few of the slot machines around the edges rather than the table games, so it was a bit weird to me, watching all these elderly people feeding their pension into slot machines, but if they're enjoying it I suppose we all have our vice!

It a very good deal and the restaurant was full when we arrived so it clearly popular. There was a great atmosphere buzzing with happy diners and drinkers. Service was a bit slow but friendly and our rump steaks were a little overcooked. When we ordered, we were asked how we wanted them cooked so we asked what the chef would suggest and were told this would be medium rare which we agreed to, but they were more medium to well done. This was not a massive problem as the meat was good quality, not fatty and very tasty. We did n't complain but our waitress asked how everything was so we told her. What was really good was that the manager came straight over and offered to bring out new steaks for us but we were hungry( we waited around 50 mins already) so said we eat them but he did offer us a complimentary dessert which was very much appreciated. The cheese platter we selected was delicious and absolutely huge so more than enough for us to share.

They also had these interesting displays with artifacts and information about how the Romans lived. I learned a lot about their daily routines and traditions.

"At Mr Singh all vegetarian restaurant & takeaway vegetarians are treated to a delightful selection of meat-free alternatives that rival their carnivorous counterparts. From hot dogs to chicken burgers, tandoori chicken-style pizzas and delicious French fries, Mr Singh offers a diverse menu catering to vegetarian tastes. The four star rating I have given is largely attributed to the standout dish, the chilli paneer pizza, which boasts a perfect blend of spice and cheesiness that tantalizes the taste buds with every bite, which In my opinion is the highlight of Mr Singh menu. While the food impresses, the ambiance could benefit from a modern touch. The dcor and furnishings appear dated, detracting slightly from the overall dining experience for those choosing to dine in-restaurant. The Service is satisfactory but could be more attentive to elevate the dining experience further. As far as beverages go, Unfortunately, the milkshakes leave something to be desired, lacking the thick, creamy texture that milkshake aficionados crave. In conclusion, Mr Singh offers a vegetarian haven for those seeking flavorful meat-free options. While there are areas for improvement, such as updating the ambiance and refining the milkshake offerings, the delicious food makes it a worthwhile dining destination for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. I go as far as saying in terms of takeaway pizzas it possibly up there as one of the best in the midlands & surrounding areas.",1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

However, just as the movie came to an end and the credits came on, I turned on the flash on my phone so that I could pick up my bag and there it was, a baby mouse! Yuck yuck, I simply lost my mind( as rodents are my biggest fear) I immediately grabbed my stuff and ran out the cinema like a woman on fire! I was absolutely terrified and shaking. I reported my awful experience to a member of staff who was both helpful and respectful. She brought me to her Supervisor, who then called for a Manager, who was very apologetic and did take immediate action by closing down screen 3 for cleaning / pest control visit and also gifted me with two complimentary tickets to be used at any of the Pictrehouses. I really thankful that happened at the ending of the movie, as opposed to somewhere during it, as everybody in that auditorium would have had their movie spoiled by all of my screaming!

"Went for an early dinner during the week. The thing that immediately hits u is the cleanliness which is incredibly high. People are very friendly and relaxed both the customers and waiters. We ordered from a menu in Chinese which makes it easier to understand what is actually in the food. Despite the reputation of the Sichuan region of China I must say the flavour of every dish we tried seemed sedate and blander in a way. One is expecting the explosion of flavours which assaults your senses when you are in China but here the flavours are more civilised and adapted to a less fiery palate. Food is actually abundant, well cooked and balanced and it was a pleasure to dine in. I recommend it if you want to try something different from the omnipresent Cantonese restaurants in the city without the risk of becoming a fire breathing dragon.",1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

Went to The White Sawn for lunch. Had to get past people smoking right outside the door. Once inside there was ample seating and we managed to get a nice clean table. We ordered from the app; the drinks and food arrived promptly after. The pizza we ordered was the right size as advertised and roughly the size of the plate. It was generously topped as well and tasted good. The fish and chips were also cooked well and you got a reasonable portion of chips in comparison to some of the small portions at other weatherspoons. Overall a good experience with fast service and good portion sizes. The only negative is to be prepared to go past the people sitting and smoking right by the only entrance( maybe they should move the smoking area)!,0,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

The last thing we had was the shrimp and potato curry with rice.

"I had a disappointing experience at the restaurant last night When I went to order at the counter, the staff told me to use the self-service kiosks instead. While I understand they are promoting this new technology, the young blonde woman came across as rude in her approach. I did n't receive a paper receipt at the end. After waiting 10 minutes to receive my food, I noticed concerning practices like staff picking their nose while preparing food! Keeping food warm in the fry station. Multiple staff members had untidy uniforms with only one wearing an apron, which made me wonder about the general hygiene standards. While most of the staff seemed totally lost, only two employees who stood out in a positive way and knew what they were doing I do n't know their names but the tall man with glasses who was out the back and the female employee bagging orders at the fry station.

But once I got their attention and they helped me, they were really friendly and kind. My partner went to the bar to order breakfast, so I did n't have any interaction with the bar team Monday morning, but the food was delicious and absolutely incredible value for money.

More importantly, for the price-it not all that. Your local kebab shop would taste better I sure. Other than that, the calamari was good. Burgers were good. Pie of the day was good.

You'd expect that for a place with stars( currently November 2023), that the food would be great too. With a menu that is heavily aimed towards their' signature' hanging kebabs, you'd at least expect them to be good. Honestly, they were the driest kebabs I've ever had, apart from the one time I tried to make some from scratch using an oven as a teenager. Haha. The pictures really appear more juicy than they are. The chicken took actual force to get the fork into and the prawn kebab was just.. cold. Really not good enough for the price they charge. Looking around past the greenery and chic decorations you can see several other couples who have finished their cocktails( 80 % ice) and are also waiting for too long for their meals.

"Ahoy there, fellow breakfast adventurers! Avocado toast enthusiasts, rejoice! Gail Bakery is a curious nook in Altrincham town center that'll have you hooked and wanting to come back for more! The avocado toast was the stuff of legends, sending my taste buds on a rollercoaster ride of delight! But wait, it gets better! The secret weapon was the mysterious and alluring Salsa Verde sauce, served on the side like a daring sidekick ready to take on any culinary challenge! Speaking of challenges, I faced the flat white quest next. It was acceptable, though it lacked a bit of magic. Still, it played well with the avocado toast, so we'll call it a breakfast truce! Now, time to unravel the bagel enigma! The bagel, ceremoniously crowned with a luscious blend of Jam and butter, whispered sweet nothings into my taste receptors. Oh, how it charmed my senses! The space inside the bakery is a cozy hug; think of it as breakfast in a warm embrace! However, if you prefer basking in the sunlight while munching on your treats, you'll have to roll the dice with the weather. Outdoor seating is a fair-weather friend, but when it cooperates, it's a treat! Attention parents, mini-humans are welcome here! The vibe is kid-friendly, and it's a decent spot to enjoy breakfast with your little ones as long as it's not peak hour madness! To sum it all up, Gail Bakery is like an enchanted breakfast nook that sprinkles a dash of quirkiness into your morning routine.

"Our inaugural visit to the cafe in Wakefield City Center unfolded as a pleasant surprise, marked by affordability and hearty portions. Although the name eludes my memory, the overall experience left a lasting impression. The cafe proved to be a budget-friendly haven, offering a range of options without denting the wallet. We opted for a burger meal and a hot wings meal, enticed by the promise of satisfying our hunger without breaking the bank. The portions were generous, a welcome sight for voracious appetites. The burger meal and hot wings meal arrived promptly, exuding tempting aromas that hinted at the flavors awaiting exploration. The affordability-to-portion ratio set the stage for what promised to be a fulfilling dining experience. The first bites revealed a commendable effort in crafting enjoyable fare. While the flavors were commendable, the lack of a satisfying crunch was a notable point of consideration. Despite the minor crispiness setback, the food resonated well with my hunger-stricken state. The savory notes and ample portions compensated for the nuanced aspect, ensuring an enjoyable meal. It's a testament to the cafe ability to deliver on the fundamental promise of satiating hunger at an affordable price. Regrettably, the cafe name escapes my recollection, hindering the ability to give due credit to this hidden gem in Wakefield City Center. The overall enjoyment of the food and the satisfaction of a well-fed appetite make this establishment a contender for future visits. A hidden gem indeed, awaiting a more memorable encore. # WakefieldCafeExperience # AffordableEats",1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

Breakfast the first morning was something to be desired.... But this was due to a different chef on, as the following morning it was lovely. We had dinner in the bar downstairs, the food was lovely and we were entitled to 2 courses from the menu in with our room deal, though no atmosphere to stick around.

"Totally disappointed. I hired out the function room for my little one first birthday. On arrival to set up decorations, I found the room had n't been cleaned and to be quite brutal-messy. There was tinsel and a coat hanger on the floor, bits and food droppings in the carpet, sticky and dirty tables not cleaned and left over balloons hanging from a previous party. I fully expected the room to be cleaned and tidy for booking. Why would a function room not be cleaned down and ready for the next party ?! I asked the 1 member of staff working why the room had n't been cleaned and he could n't answer why. He also did n't have a hoover to at least get rid of the food droppings. I then asked if the heating could be turned on as it was cold. I was advised the radiators did n't work. How is this acceptable when January is exceptionally cold and not have working radiators. When I had booked this venue I asked if the upstairs bar would be open, to which I was told yes, pending staffing. A few days prior I was told the bar would be open but again another issue on the day, only 1 staff member working on the downstairs bar. Later on someone else did arrive to open the upstairs bar but had to leave. I do n't expect party guests to keep going up and down the stairs to fetch drinks. A big issue for a 1st birthday party was having no baby change facilities. This should of been stated at the time of booking. I would assume in 2024 baby change & disabled facilities are important and mandatory. I can not comment on the food here as luckily we took our own. To finish the overall poor experience with this venue, I completely forgot to ask for the deposit money back once our party had ended. It taken a week of actually going to the pub, calling, leaving voicemails and text messages to obtain my deposit back. I wo n't be returning obviously or recommending to anyone for future.",0,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

She rudely interrupted and said the bar would be getting busy, to which I replied I know, it not my first time here and we would move when it happens. She then aggressively said she would get the manager to move me away from the bar when there was no need. This caused further issues between myself and the barmaid.

Not sure if my sea bass was meant to be quite so drowned in so much olive oil. I ate the food which was delicious, and left the oil. The other 3 had steaks which they devoured.

"This TGI Fridays in Telford provided a consistently enjoyable dining experience. As a fan of American cuisine, I found their menu to be diverse and satisfying. From the moment I walked in, the energetic and lively atmosphere immediately set the tone for a fun dining experience. The staff at TGI Fridays were welcoming and attentive throughout our visit. Our server was friendly and had an excellent knowledge of the menu, assisting us in making our choices. They patiently catered to all our requests and ensured that our dining experience was pleasant. The menu offered a variety of classic American dishes, including burgers, ribs, and flavorful appetizers. We decided to try the Jack Daniel Burger, which came with a generous side of crispy fries. The burger itself was juicy and packed with delicious flavors, and the combination of the smoky Jack Daniel glaze and crispy bacon was a perfect match. The portion size was satisfying, leaving us feeling fully satisfied. In terms of ambiance, TGI Fridays exuded a vibrant and lively atmosphere. The spacious seating area was complemented by upbeat music, creating a celebratory atmosphere. The walls adorned with various memorabilia added a touch of nostalgia, further enhancing the overall experience. The only reason I am not giving a five-star rating is the occasional long wait time, especially during peak hours. However, the staff did their best to manage the crowd efficiently and keep waiting times to a minimum. Nevertheless, it's advisable to book a table in advance to avoid any potential delays. Despite the wait, TGI Fridays in Telford consistently delivers a reliable dining experience. The food is consistently flavorful, the service is attentive, and the environment is vibrant. Whether you are looking for a casual meal or a place to celebrate with friends, TGI Fridays is a great choice.

Then when you tell someone it's cold they roll their eyes at you and wander back off to the kitchen and then the person sitting across from you says they sent theirs back too because it was cold!! know these places are basically run by teenagers but this should be something the franchise owner should be keeping an eye on!,",0,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

"Great value for money, tasty food and amazing customer experience. My wife has gluten allergies so we have to be very careful about what we order, and the options become quite limited wherever we go. The chef was very thorough and came to the table to discuss the options. We ended up getting the vegetable biryani. For myself, I had the crispy fried vegetable momos( not gluten free by the way). They were spicy and delicious. Came with a sour cream sauce and a kind of sweet chilly sauce. One thing I would highly suggest is to have halal chicken options. There are a lot of Muslims in the area and we would love to support local businesses, but the options here are quite limited as we can only have the veg stuff. Would be nice to be able to eat the chicken dishes if they were halal. Overall very reasonably priced and tasty, could do with more halal and gluten free options.",1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

An unusual conversion of what I believe was an old mill into a hotel. The reception and catering are on the top floor with the accommodation on two lower floors. Room was up to standard and I appreciated the tea / coffee making kit as it was wet and gloomy over my stay. The evening food menu was not very wide but my pizza was perfectly fine. The Continental breakfast was very good. The only downside for me was the peculiar car parking arrangements. The entrance to the hotel is basically in a pay and display car park so I had to feed a meter with 90 minutes credit in the afternoon and skedaddle early in the morning to avoid paying any more! For once probably best to be a pedestrian.,1,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

"I have been coming here for breakfast almost three or more times a week for 6 months, the breakfasts are always of a good standard and usually sent out in a timely manner. The menu has recently had an updated price which I find absolutely ridiculous, you now charge extra for absolutely everything ? In the last few days I had eggs Benedict with extra bacon and you charge for one slice of bacon ? This is unbelievable considering a pack of bacon is about 2. For 2 breakfasts with drinks( you always allowed the speciality hot chocolate onto the added drink but now you do n't allow this ? Even charging me full price for coffee with a syrup) it was 50 for this with 2 smoothies ? Which cost per smoothie even though supplier sells them at each. Previously we could eat a good breakfast in here with 2 decent drinks for just shy of 30( still expensive for Doncaster but we always paid happily due to quality) now I feel this rise in price does n't reflect the current state of people living standards, making the place feel pretentious and only about making more money.

Only 1 time it was so hot that the cheese was still soft, all the other times it was warm. Even though we are only a 5 minute drive away( but do n't drive). On one occasion, I found a hair and called to complain. I was called a liar and when I asked to be put through to a manager I was told no manager was in but he'd leave a message. I never got a call back. Every single time we have ordered a pizza with chicken on it, they put tandoori chicken on it. On their menu they have 4 different kinds of chicken, including plain. Logically, if it does n't mention what kind it is, you'd assume it means plain. We called months ago to check that the pizza would have plain chicken on it and we were told "" of course! We'd never do otherwise "". Last week we got a chicken pizza and surprise surprise they put tandoori chicken on it! It's so strong tasting, it completely changes the taste of the whole pizza. We called to complain and we were told all pizzas come with tandoori chicken and that we should have mentioned it during the order and it's our fault that we did n't know that chicken means tandoori chicken. I asked if they can at least change the menu so it's obvious you're not getting plain chicken, but was told no other customer has complained so obviously my complaint is invalid. According to the reviews on Just Eat, I am not the only one unhappy with the misleading description. This time I was apparently speaking to a shift manager, who clearly knows nothing about customer service. He was incredibly rude and spoke over me.

"Been here many times and this review should be 5 stars, however today as I am writing this review, I have not just taken into consideration the product( Coffee), but have also taken in to consideration the messy workplace the staff are working in to give a true review reflection of my visit, as after all this is what reviews are supposed to do is n't it ? The coffee from Costa is the same everywhere you go so you know what you are expecting when you get served. 5 stars for this. Today it was busy in this branch of Costa( Vision Retail Park, Hartlepool) and staff seemed very pushed for the duration I was there. This obviously led to corners being cut in terms of cleanliness on the floor and the coffee machines themselves. The coffee machines were dirty, the floors were very unhygienic behind the counter with brushes and other things laid around, along with it being very dirty for the customers to see.( Pictures attached to the review). Interestingly, the steamer for the milk was only wiped down after use for everyone, and no steam was blown through the pipe to expel any milk that may have gotten up the spout. My question would be what if someone had a dairy allergy and that spout was used after serving someone with normal milk and expelled some normal milk into their drink ? Surely a clean short blast of steam for each use would sort this potential issue out ? The staff were polite and accommodating and I have found this on every visit to this branch of Costa so kudos to the team there. Despite today visit being a kind of "" scruffy "" experience with Costa, I will be back as it is a handy place to conduct my meetings. Perhaps Costa can invest in more staff resourcing at known busy times so the customer experience can be heightened further.",0,en-UK,Google,Sentiment

Let's say we invest 10 of that lost 18 billion into increased prison capacity. That would house an additional 200k people. We could literally triple our prison population and still be saving money. This whole economic benefit of releasing people is a myth.
People have this fairy tinted view that everyone can be reformed, they can't. It's not uncommon for prolific offenders to have anywhere from 100-300 convictions. Releasing them does nothing but bring more misery into their local communities because it is a certainty they will reoffend.

Personally I think it's absolutely insane this is even being discussed. What should be happening is that income tax bands move upwards specifically to benefit people who are cash poor.
The reasons why removing this tax is insane:
- It primarily benefits wealthy pensioners. It's a massive gaping hole through which cash rich people will funnel money if they can just take gigantic tax free pension payments in year 1 of their retirement
- shifts even more tax burden to young people, who provably have higher living expenses (rent, transport, student loans) than most all pensioners.
- Young people probably won't get the same deal as pension age gets yanked out of reach.
